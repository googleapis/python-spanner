Tracing with OpenTelemetry
==========================

This library uses `OpenTelemetry <https://opentelemetry.io/>`_ to automatically generate traces providing insight on calls to Cloud Spanner. 
For information on the benefits and utility of tracing, see the `Cloud Trace docs <https://cloud.google.com/trace/docs/overview>`_.

To take advantage of these traces, we first need to install OpenTelemetry:

.. code-block:: sh

    pip install opentelemetry-api opentelemetry-sdk
    pip install opentelemetry-exporter-gcp-trace

We also need to tell OpenTelemetry which exporter to use. To export Spanner traces to `Cloud Tracing <https://cloud.google.com/trace>`_, add the following lines to your application:

.. code:: python

    from opentelemetry import trace
    from opentelemetry.sdk.trace import TracerProvider
    from opentelemetry.sdk.trace.sampling import TraceIdRatioBased
    from opentelemetry.exporter.cloud_trace import CloudTraceSpanExporter
    # BatchSpanProcessor exports spans to Cloud Trace
    # in a seperate thread to not block on the main thread
    from opentelemetry.sdk.trace.export import BatchSpanProcessor

    # Create and export one trace every 1000 requests
    sampler = TraceIdRatioBased(1/1000)
    tracer_provider = TracerProvider(sampler=sampler)
    tracer_provider.add_span_processor(
        # Initialize the cloud tracing exporter
        BatchSpanProcessor(CloudTraceSpanExporter())
    )
    observability_options = dict(
        tracer_provider=tracer_provider,
        enable_extended_tracing=True,
    )
    spanner = spanner.NewClient(project_id, observability_options=observability_options)


To get more fine-grained traces from gRPC, you can enable the gRPC instrumentation by the following

.. code-block:: sh

    pip install opentelemetry-instrumentation opentelemetry-instrumentation-grpc

and then in your Python code, please add the following lines:

.. code:: python

   from opentelemetry.instrumentation.grpc import GrpcInstrumentorClient
   grpc_client_instrumentor = GrpcInstrumentorClient()
   grpc_client_instrumentor.instrument()


Generated spanner traces should now be available on `Cloud Trace <https://console.cloud.google.com/traces>`_.

Tracing is most effective when many libraries are instrumented to provide insight over the entire lifespan of a request.
For a list of libraries that can be instrumented, see the `OpenTelemetry Integrations` section of the `OpenTelemetry Python docs <https://opentelemetry-python.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`_
