This module provides functionality for capturing metrics in Cloud Spanner operations.

It includes a context manager class, MetricsCapture, which automatically handles the
start and completion of metrics tracing for a given operation. This ensures that metrics
are consistently recorded for Cloud Spanner operations, facilitating observability and
performance monitoring.
