    ``TypeCode`` is used as part of ``Type`` to indicate the type of a
    Cloud Spanner value.

    Each legal value of a type can be encoded to or decoded from a JSON
    value, using the encodings described below. All Cloud Spanner values can
    be ``null``, regardless of type; ``null``\ s are always encoded as a
    JSON ``null``.

    Attributes:
      TYPE_CODE_UNSPECIFIED (int): Not specified.
      BOOL (int): Encoded as JSON ``true`` or ``false``.
      INT64 (int): Encoded as ``string``, in decimal format.
      FLOAT64 (int): Encoded as ``number``, or the strings ``"NaN"``, ``"Infinity"``, or
      ``"-Infinity"``.
      TIMESTAMP (int): Encoded as ``string`` in RFC 3339 timestamp format. The time zone
      must be present, and must be ``"Z"``.

      If the schema has the column option ``allow_commit_timestamp=true``, the
      placeholder string ``"spanner.commit_timestamp()"`` can be used to
      instruct the system to insert the commit timestamp associated with the
      transaction commit.
      DATE (int): Encoded as ``string`` in RFC 3339 date format.
      STRING (int): Encoded as ``string``.
      BYTES (int): Encoded as a base64-encoded ``string``, as described in RFC 4648,
      section 4.
      ARRAY (int): Encoded as ``list``, where the list elements are represented
      according to ``array_element_type``.
      STRUCT (int): Encoded as ``list``, where list element ``i`` is represented
      according to
      [struct_type.fields[i]][google.spanner.v1.StructType.fields].
      NUMERIC (int): Encoded as ``string``, in decimal format or scientific notation
      format. Decimal format: \ ``[+-]Digits[.[Digits]]`` or
      \``+-\ ``.Digits``

      \ ``[+-]Digits[.[Digits]][ExponentIndicator[+-]Digits]`` or
