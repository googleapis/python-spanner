    class ReadOnly(proto.Message):
        r"""Message type to initiate a read-only transaction.

        Attributes:
            strong (bool):
                Read at a timestamp where all previously
                committed transactions are visible.
            min_read_timestamp (~.timestamp.Timestamp):
                Executes all reads at a timestamp >= ``min_read_timestamp``.

                This is useful for requesting fresher data than some
                previous read, or data that is fresh enough to observe the
                effects of some previously committed transaction whose
                timestamp is known.

                Note that this option can only be used in single-use
                transactions.

                A timestamp in RFC3339 UTC "Zulu" format, accurate to
                nanoseconds. Example: ``"2014-10-02T15:01:23.045123456Z"``.
            max_staleness (~.duration.Duration):
                Read data at a timestamp >= ``NOW - max_staleness`` seconds.
                Guarantees that all writes that have committed more than the
                specified number of seconds ago are visible. Because Cloud
                Spanner chooses the exact timestamp, this mode works even if
                the client's local clock is substantially skewed from Cloud
                Spanner commit timestamps.

                Useful for reading the freshest data available at a nearby
                replica, while bounding the possible staleness if the local
                replica has fallen behind.

                Note that this option can only be used in single-use
                transactions.
            read_timestamp (~.timestamp.Timestamp):
                Executes all reads at the given timestamp. Unlike other
                modes, reads at a specific timestamp are repeatable; the
                same read at the same timestamp always returns the same
                data. If the timestamp is in the future, the read will block
                until the specified timestamp, modulo the read's deadline.

                Useful for large scale consistent reads such as mapreduces,
                or for coordinating many reads against a consistent snapshot
                of the data.

                A timestamp in RFC3339 UTC "Zulu" format, accurate to
                nanoseconds. Example: ``"2014-10-02T15:01:23.045123456Z"``.
            exact_staleness (~.duration.Duration):
                Executes all reads at a timestamp that is
                ``exact_staleness`` old. The timestamp is chosen soon after
                the read is started.

                Guarantees that all writes that have committed more than the
                specified number of seconds ago are visible. Because Cloud
                Spanner chooses the exact timestamp, this mode works even if
                the client's local clock is substantially skewed from Cloud
                Spanner commit timestamps.

                Useful for reading at nearby replicas without the
                distributed timestamp negotiation overhead of
                ``max_staleness``.
            return_read_timestamp (bool):
                If true, the Cloud Spanner-selected read timestamp is
                included in the [Transaction][google.spanner.v1.Transaction]
                message that describes the transaction.
