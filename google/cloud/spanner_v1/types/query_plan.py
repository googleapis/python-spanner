    Attributes:
        index (int):
            The ``PlanNode``'s index in [node
            list][google.spanner.v1.QueryPlan.plan_nodes].
        kind (google.cloud.spanner_v1.types.PlanNode.Kind):
            Used to determine the type of node. May be needed for
            visualizing different kinds of nodes differently. For
            example, If the node is a
            [SCALAR][google.spanner.v1.PlanNode.Kind.SCALAR] node, it
            will have a condensed representation which can be used to
            directly embed a description of the node in its parent.
        display_name (str):
            The display name for the node.
        child_links (MutableSequence[google.cloud.spanner_v1.types.PlanNode.ChildLink]):
            List of child node ``index``\ es and their relationship to
            this parent.
        short_representation (google.cloud.spanner_v1.types.PlanNode.ShortRepresentation):
            Condensed representation for
            [SCALAR][google.spanner.v1.PlanNode.Kind.SCALAR] nodes.
        metadata (google.protobuf.struct_pb2.Struct):
            Attributes relevant to the node contained in a group of
            key-value pairs. For example, a Parameter Reference node
            could have the following information in its metadata:

            ::

                {
                  "parameter_reference": "param1",
                  "parameter_type": "array"
                }
        execution_stats (google.protobuf.struct_pb2.Struct):
            The execution statistics associated with the
            node, contained in a group of key-value pairs.
            Only present if the plan was returned as a
            result of a profile query. For example, number
            of executions, number of rows/time per execution
            etc.

            RELATIONAL (1):
                Denotes a Relational operator node in the expression tree.
                Relational operators represent iterative processing of rows
                during query execution. For example, a ``TableScan``
                operation that reads rows from a table.
            SCALAR (2):
                Denotes a Scalar node in the expression tree.
                Scalar nodes represent non-iterable entities in
                the query plan. For example, constants or
                arithmetic operators appearing inside predicate
                expressions or references to column names.

            child_index (int):
                The node to which the link points.
            type_ (str):
                The type of the link. For example, in Hash
                Joins this could be used to distinguish between
                the build child and the probe child, or in the
                case of the child being an output variable, to
                represent the tag associated with the output
                variable.

                [SCALAR][google.spanner.v1.PlanNode.Kind.SCALAR] and
                corresponds to an output variable of the parent node. The
                field carries the name of the output variable. For example,

                output variables created for each column that is read by the
