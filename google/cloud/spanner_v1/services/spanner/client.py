        Sessions can only execute one transaction at a time. To execute

        multiple sessions. Note that standalone reads and queries use a

        Active sessions use additional server resources, so it is a good
        idea to delete idle and unneeded sessions. Aside from explicit
        deletes, Cloud Spanner may delete sessions for which no
        operations are sent for more than an hour. If a session is
        deleted, requests to it return ``NOT_FOUND``.

        Idle sessions can be kept alive by sending a trivial SQL query

        This API can be used to initialize a session cache on
        the clients. See https://goo.gl/TgSFN2 for best
        practices on session cache management.

        Args:

                Required. The database in which the
                new sessions are created.

                This corresponds to the ``database`` field
                on the ``request`` instance; if ``request`` is provided, this
                should not be set.

                Required. The number of sessions to be created in this
                batch call. The API may return fewer than the requested
                number of sessions. If a specific number of sessions are
                desired, the client can make additional calls to
                BatchCreateSessions (adjusting
                [session_count][google.spanner.v1.BatchCreateSessionsRequest.session_count]

                This corresponds to the ``session_count`` field
                on the ``request`` instance; if ``request`` is provided, this
                should not be set.
            retry (google.api_core.retry.Retry): Designation of what errors, if any,
                should be retried.
            timeout (float): The timeout for this request.
            metadata (Sequence[Tuple[str, str]]): Strings which should be
                sent along with the request as metadata.

        Returns:
            google.cloud.spanner_v1.types.ExecuteBatchDmlResponse:
                The response for [ExecuteBatchDml][google.spanner.v1.Spanner.ExecuteBatchDml]. Contains a list
                   of [ResultSet][google.spanner.v1.ResultSet] messages,
                   one for each DML statement that has successfully
                   executed, in the same order as the statements in the
                   request. If a statement fails, the status in the
                   response body identifies the cause of the failure.

                   To check for DML statements that failed, use the
                   following approach:

                   1. Check the status in the response message. The
                      [google.rpc.Code][google.rpc.Code] enum value OK
                      indicates that all statements were executed
                      successfully.
                   2. If the status was not OK, check the number of
                      result sets in the response. If the response
                      contains N
                      [ResultSet][google.spanner.v1.ResultSet] messages,
                      then statement N+1 in the request failed.

                   Example 1:

                   -  Request: 5 DML statements, all executed
                      successfully.
                   -  Response: 5
                      [ResultSet][google.spanner.v1.ResultSet] messages,
                      with the status OK.

                   Example 2:

                   -  Request: 5 DML statements. The third statement has
                      a syntax error.
                   -  Response: 2
                      [ResultSet][google.spanner.v1.ResultSet] messages,
                      and a syntax error (INVALID_ARGUMENT) status. The
                      number of [ResultSet][google.spanner.v1.ResultSet]
                      messages indicates that the third statement
                      failed, and the fourth and fifth statements were
                      not executed.

                on the ``request`` instance; if ``request`` is provided, this
                should not be set.
            transaction_id (bytes):
                Required. The transaction to roll
                back.

                This corresponds to the ``transaction_id`` field
                on the ``request`` instance; if ``request`` is provided, this
                should not be set.
            retry (google.api_core.retry.Retry): Designation of what errors, if any,
                should be retried.
            timeout (float): The timeout for this request.
