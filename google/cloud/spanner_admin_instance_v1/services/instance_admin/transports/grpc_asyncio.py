    Cloud Spanner Instance Admin API

    The Cloud Spanner Instance Admin API can be used to create,
    delete, modify and list instances. Instances are dedicated Cloud
    Spanner serving and storage resources to be used by Cloud
    Spanner databases.

    Each instance has a "configuration", which dictates where the
    serving resources for the Cloud Spanner instance are located
    (e.g., US-central, Europe). Configurations are created by Google
    based on resource availability.

    Cloud Spanner billing is based on the instances that exist and
    their sizes. After an instance exists, there are no additional
    per-database or per-operation charges for use of the instance
    (though there may be additional network bandwidth charges).
    Instances offer isolation: problems with databases in one
    instance will not affect other instances. However, within an
    instance databases can affect each other. For example, if one
    database in an instance receives a lot of requests and consumes
    most of the instance resources, fewer resources are available
    for other databases in that instance, and their performance may
    suffer.

    This class defines the same methods as the primary client, so the
    primary client can load the underlying transport implementation
    and call it.

    It sends protocol buffers over the wire using gRPC (which is built on
    top of HTTP/2); the ``grpcio`` package must be installed.

        Cancellation is not immediate because it involves moving any
        data previously moved to the target instance configuration back
