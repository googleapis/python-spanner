class InstanceAdminGrpcTransport(InstanceAdminTransport):
    """gRPC backend transport for InstanceAdmin.

    Cloud Spanner Instance Admin API
    The Cloud Spanner Instance Admin API can be used to create,
    delete, modify and list instances. Instances are dedicated Cloud
    Spanner serving and storage resources to be used by Cloud
    Spanner databases.
    Each instance has a "configuration", which dictates where the
    serving resources for the Cloud Spanner instance are located
    (e.g., US-central, Europe). Configurations are created by Google
    based on resource availability.

    Cloud Spanner billing is based on the instances that exist and
    their sizes. After an instance exists, there are no additional
    per-database or per-operation charges for use of the instance
    (though there may be additional network bandwidth charges).
    Instances offer isolation: problems with databases in one
    instance will not affect other instances. However, within an
    instance databases can affect each other. For example, if one
    database in an instance receives a lot of requests and consumes
    most of the instance resources, fewer resources are available
    for other databases in that instance, and their performance may
    suffer.

    This class defines the same methods as the primary client, so the
    primary client can load the underlying transport implementation
    and call it.

    It sends protocol buffers over the wire using gRPC (which is built on
    top of HTTP/2); the ``grpcio`` package must be installed.

    ]:
        r"""Return a callable for the update instance method over gRPC.

        Updates an instance, and begins allocating or releasing
        resources as requested. The returned [long-running
        operation][google.longrunning.Operation] can be used to track
        the progress of updating the instance. If the named instance
        does not exist, returns ``NOT_FOUND``.

        Immediately upon completion of this request:

        -  For resource types for which a decrease in the instance's
           allocation has been requested, billing is based on the
           newly-requested level.

        Until completion of the returned operation:

        -  Cancelling the operation sets its metadata's
           [cancel_time][google.spanner.admin.instance.v1.UpdateInstanceMetadata.cancel_time],
           and begins restoring resources to their pre-request values.
           The operation is guaranteed to succeed at undoing all
           resource changes, after which point it terminates with a
           ``CANCELLED`` status.
        -  All other attempts to modify the instance are rejected.
        -  Reading the instance via the API continues to give the
           pre-request resource levels.

        Upon completion of the returned operation:

        -  Billing begins for all successfully-allocated resources (some
           types may have lower than the requested levels).
        -  All newly-reserved resources are available for serving the
           instance's tables.
        -  The instance's new resource levels are readable via the API.

        The returned [long-running
        operation][google.longrunning.Operation] will have a name of the
        format ``<instance_name>/operations/<operation_id>`` and can be
        used to track the instance modification. The
        [metadata][google.longrunning.Operation.metadata] field type is
        [UpdateInstanceMetadata][google.spanner.admin.instance.v1.UpdateInstanceMetadata].
        The [response][google.longrunning.Operation.response] field type
        is [Instance][google.spanner.admin.instance.v1.Instance], if
        successful.
