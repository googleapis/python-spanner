            appears in UIs.
        config_type (google.cloud.spanner_admin_instance_v1.types.InstanceConfig.Type):
            Output only. Whether this instance

            user-managed configuration.
        replicas (MutableSequence[google.cloud.spanner_admin_instance_v1.types.ReplicaInfo]):
            The geographic placement of nodes in this instance
            configuration and their replication properties.

            To create user-managed configurations, input ``replicas``
            must include all replicas in ``replicas`` of the
            ``base_config`` and include one or more replicas in the
            ``optional_replicas`` of the ``base_config``.
        optional_replicas (MutableSequence[google.cloud.spanner_admin_instance_v1.types.ReplicaInfo]):
            Output only. The available optional replicas
            to choose from for user-managed configurations.
            Populated for Google-managed configurations.
        base_config (str):
            Base configuration name, e.g.
            projects/<project_name>/instanceConfigs/nam3, based on which
            this configuration is created. Only set for user-managed
            configurations. ``base_config`` must refer to a
            configuration of type ``GOOGLE_MANAGED`` in the same project
            as this configuration.
        labels (MutableMapping[str, str]):
            Cloud Labels are a flexible and lightweight mechanism for
            organizing cloud resources into groups that reflect a
            customer's organizational needs and deployment strategies.
            Cloud Labels can be used to filter collections of resources.
            They can be used to control how resource metrics are
            aggregated. And they can be used as arguments to policy
            management rules (e.g. route, firewall, load balancing,
            etc.).

            -  Label keys must be between 1 and 63 characters long and
               must conform to the following regular expression:
               ``[a-z][a-z0-9_-]{0,62}``.
            -  Label values must be between 0 and 63 characters long and
               must conform to the regular expression
               ``[a-z0-9_-]{0,63}``.
            -  No more than 64 labels can be associated with a given
               resource.

            See https://goo.gl/xmQnxf for more information on and
            examples of labels.

            If you plan to use labels in your own code, please note that
            additional characters may be allowed in the future.
            Therefore, you are advised to use an internal label
            representation, such as JSON, which doesn't rely upon
            specific characters being disallowed. For example,
            representing labels as the string: name + "*" + value would
            prove problematic if we were to allow "*" in a future
            release.
        etag (str):
            etag is used for optimistic concurrency
            control as a way to help prevent simultaneous
            updates of a instance configuration from
            overwriting each other. It is strongly suggested
            that systems make use of the etag in the
            read-modify-write cycle to perform instance
            configuration updates in order to avoid race
            conditions: An etag is returned in the response
            which contains instance configurations, and
            systems are expected to put that etag in the
            request to update instance configuration to
            ensure that their change is applied to the same
            version of the instance configuration. If no
            etag is provided in the call to update the
            instance configuration, then the existing
            instance configuration is overwritten blindly.
        leader_options (MutableSequence[str]):
            Allowed values of the "default_leader" schema option for
            databases in instances that use this instance configuration.
        reconciling (bool):
            Output only. If true, the instance
            configuration is being created or updated. If
            false, there are no ongoing operations for the
            instance configuration.
        state (google.cloud.spanner_admin_instance_v1.types.InstanceConfig.State):
            Output only. The current instance configuration state.
            Applicable only for ``USER_MANAGED`` configurations.
        free_instance_availability (google.cloud.spanner_admin_instance_v1.types.InstanceConfig.FreeInstanceAvailability):
            Output only. Describes whether free instances

            configuration.
        quorum_type (google.cloud.spanner_admin_instance_v1.types.InstanceConfig.QuorumType):
            Output only. The ``QuorumType`` of the instance
            configuration.

            Cloud Labels are a flexible and lightweight mechanism for
            organizing cloud resources into groups that reflect a
            customer's organizational needs and deployment strategies.
            Cloud Labels can be used to filter collections of resources.
            They can be used to control how resource metrics are
            aggregated. And they can be used as arguments to policy
            management rules (e.g. route, firewall, load balancing,
            etc.).

            -  Label keys must be between 1 and 63 characters long and
               must conform to the following regular expression:
               ``[a-z][a-z0-9_-]{0,62}``.
            -  Label values must be between 0 and 63 characters long and
               must conform to the regular expression
               ``[a-z0-9_-]{0,63}``.
            -  No more than 64 labels can be associated with a given
               resource.

            See https://goo.gl/xmQnxf for more information on and
            examples of labels.

            If you plan to use labels in your own code, please note that
            additional characters may be allowed in the future. And so
            you are advised to use an internal label representation,
            such as JSON, which doesn't rely upon specific characters
            being disallowed. For example, representing labels as the
            string: name + "*" + value would prove problematic if we
            were to allow "*" in a future release.

            created in a new instance.

            Note that the ``AUTOMATIC`` value isn't permitted for free
            instances, as backups and backup schedules aren't supported
            for free instances.

            Required. The project of the instance configuration
            operations. Values are of the form ``projects/<project>``.
        filter (str):
            An expression that filters the list of returned operations.

            A filter expression consists of a field name, a comparison
            operator, and a value for filtering. The value must be a
            string, a number, or a boolean. The comparison operator must
            be one of: ``<``, ``>``, ``<=``, ``>=``, ``!=``, ``=``, or
            ``:``. Colon ``:`` is the contains operator. Filter rules
            are not case sensitive.

            The following fields in the Operation are eligible for
            filtering:

            -  ``name`` - The name of the long-running operation
            -  ``done`` - False if the operation is in progress, else
               true.
            -  ``metadata.@type`` - the type of metadata. For example,
               the type string for
               [CreateInstanceConfigMetadata][google.spanner.admin.instance.v1.CreateInstanceConfigMetadata]
               is
               ``type.googleapis.com/google.spanner.admin.instance.v1.CreateInstanceConfigMetadata``.
            -  ``metadata.<field_name>`` - any field in metadata.value.
               ``metadata.@type`` must be specified first, if filtering
               on metadata fields.
            -  ``error`` - Error associated with the long-running
               operation.
            -  ``response.@type`` - the type of response.
            -  ``response.<field_name>`` - any field in response.value.

            You can combine multiple expressions by enclosing each
            expression in parentheses. By default, expressions are
            combined with AND logic. However, you can specify AND, OR,
            and NOT logic explicitly.

            Here are a few examples:

            -  ``done:true`` - The operation is complete.
            -  ``(metadata.@type=``
               ``type.googleapis.com/google.spanner.admin.instance.v1.CreateInstanceConfigMetadata) AND``
               ``(metadata.instance_config.name:custom-config) AND``
               ``(metadata.progress.start_time < \"2021-03-28T14:50:00Z\") AND``
               ``(error:*)`` - Return operations where:

               -  The operation's metadata type is
                  [CreateInstanceConfigMetadata][google.spanner.admin.instance.v1.CreateInstanceConfigMetadata].
               -  The instance configuration name contains
                  "custom-config".
               -  The operation started before 2021-03-28T14:50:00Z.
               -  The operation resulted in an error.
        page_size (int):
            Number of operations to be returned in the
            response. If 0 or less, defaults to the server's
            maximum allowed page size.
        page_token (str):

            Output only. The names of the databases that
            reference this instance partition. Referencing

            instance partition from overwriting each other.
            It is strongly suggested that systems make use
            of the etag in the read-modify-write cycle to
            perform instance partition updates in order to
            avoid race conditions: An etag is returned in
            the response which contains instance partitions,
            and systems are expected to put that etag in the
            request to update instance partitions to ensure
            that their change will be applied to the same
            version of the instance partition. If no etag is

    Attributes:
        parent (str):
            Required. The parent instance of the instance partition
            operations. Values are of the form
            ``projects/<project>/instances/<instance>``.
        filter (str):
            Optional. An expression that filters the list of returned
            operations.

            A filter expression consists of a field name, a comparison
            operator, and a value for filtering. The value must be a
            string, a number, or a boolean. The comparison operator must
            be one of: ``<``, ``>``, ``<=``, ``>=``, ``!=``, ``=``, or
            ``:``. Colon ``:`` is the contains operator. Filter rules
            are not case sensitive.

            The following fields in the Operation are eligible for
            filtering:

            -  ``name`` - The name of the long-running operation
            -  ``done`` - False if the operation is in progress, else
               true.
            -  ``metadata.@type`` - the type of metadata. For example,
               the type string for
               [CreateInstancePartitionMetadata][google.spanner.admin.instance.v1.CreateInstancePartitionMetadata]
               is
               ``type.googleapis.com/google.spanner.admin.instance.v1.CreateInstancePartitionMetadata``.
            -  ``metadata.<field_name>`` - any field in metadata.value.
               ``metadata.@type`` must be specified first, if filtering
               on metadata fields.
            -  ``error`` - Error associated with the long-running
               operation.
            -  ``response.@type`` - the type of response.
            -  ``response.<field_name>`` - any field in response.value.

            You can combine multiple expressions by enclosing each
            expression in parentheses. By default, expressions are
            combined with AND logic. However, you can specify AND, OR,
            and NOT logic explicitly.

            Here are a few examples:

            -  ``done:true`` - The operation is complete.
            -  ``(metadata.@type=``
               ``type.googleapis.com/google.spanner.admin.instance.v1.CreateInstancePartitionMetadata) AND``
               ``(metadata.instance_partition.name:custom-instance-partition) AND``
               ``(metadata.start_time < \"2021-03-28T14:50:00Z\") AND``
               ``(error:*)`` - Return operations where:

               -  The operation's metadata type is
                  [CreateInstancePartitionMetadata][google.spanner.admin.instance.v1.CreateInstancePartitionMetadata].
               -  The instance partition name contains
                  "custom-instance-partition".
               -  The operation started before 2021-03-28T14:50:00Z.
               -  The operation resulted in an error.
        page_size (int):
            Optional. Number of operations to be returned
            in the response. If 0 or less, defaults to the
            server's maximum allowed page size.
        page_token (str):
            Optional. If non-empty, ``page_token`` should contain a
            [next_page_token][google.spanner.admin.instance.v1.ListInstancePartitionOperationsResponse.next_page_token]
            from a previous
            [ListInstancePartitionOperationsResponse][google.spanner.admin.instance.v1.ListInstancePartitionOperationsResponse]
