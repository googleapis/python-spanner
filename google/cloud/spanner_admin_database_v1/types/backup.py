class Backup(proto.Message):
    r"""A backup of a Cloud Spanner database.

    Attributes:
        database (str):
            Required for the
            [CreateBackup][google.spanner.admin.database.v1.DatabaseAdmin.CreateBackup]
            operation. Name of the database from which this backup was
            created. This needs to be in the same instance as the
            backup. Values are of the form
            ``projects/<project>/instances/<instance>/databases/<database>``.
        version_time (google.protobuf.timestamp_pb2.Timestamp):
            The backup will contain an externally consistent copy of the
            database at the timestamp specified by ``version_time``. If
            ``version_time`` is not specified, the system will set
            ``version_time`` to the ``create_time`` of the backup.
        expire_time (google.protobuf.timestamp_pb2.Timestamp):
            Required for the
            [CreateBackup][google.spanner.admin.database.v1.DatabaseAdmin.CreateBackup]
            operation. The expiration time of the backup, with
            microseconds granularity that must be at least 6 hours and
            at most 366 days from the time the CreateBackup request is
            processed. Once the ``expire_time`` has passed, the backup
            is eligible to be automatically deleted by Cloud Spanner to
            free the resources used by the backup.
        name (str):
            Output only for the
            [CreateBackup][google.spanner.admin.database.v1.DatabaseAdmin.CreateBackup]
            operation. Required for the
            [UpdateBackup][google.spanner.admin.database.v1.DatabaseAdmin.UpdateBackup]
            operation.

            A globally unique identifier for the backup which cannot be
            changed. Values are of the form
            ``projects/<project>/instances/<instance>/backups/[a-z][a-z0-9_\-]*[a-z0-9]``
            The final segment of the name must be between 2 and 60
            characters in length.

            The backup is stored in the location(s) specified in the
            instance configuration of the instance containing the
            backup, identified by the prefix of the backup name of the
            form ``projects/<project>/instances/<instance>``.
        create_time (google.protobuf.timestamp_pb2.Timestamp):
            Output only. The time the
            [CreateBackup][google.spanner.admin.database.v1.DatabaseAdmin.CreateBackup]
            request is received. If the request does not specify
            ``version_time``, the ``version_time`` of the backup will be
            equivalent to the ``create_time``.
        size_bytes (int):
            Output only. Size of the backup in bytes.
        freeable_size_bytes (int):
            Output only. The number of bytes that will be
            freed by deleting this backup. This value will
            be zero if, for example, this backup is part of
            an incremental backup chain and younger backups
            in the chain require that we keep its data. For
            backups not in an incremental backup chain, this
            is always the size of the backup. This value may
            change if backups on the same chain get created,
            deleted or expired.
        exclusive_size_bytes (int):
            Output only. For a backup in an incremental
            backup chain, this is the storage space needed
            to keep the data that has changed since the
            previous backup. For all other backups, this is
            always the size of the backup. This value may
            change if backups on the same chain get deleted
            or expired.

            This field can be used to calculate the total
            storage space used by a set of backups. For
            example, the total space used by all backups of
            a database can be computed by summing up this
            field.
        state (google.cloud.spanner_admin_database_v1.types.Backup.State):
            Output only. The current state of the backup.
        referencing_databases (MutableSequence[str]):
            Output only. The names of the restored databases that
            reference the backup. The database names are of the form
            ``projects/<project>/instances/<instance>/databases/<database>``.
            Referencing databases may exist in different instances. The
            existence of any referencing database prevents the backup
            from being deleted. When a restored database from the backup
            enters the ``READY`` state, the reference to the backup is
            removed.
        encryption_info (google.cloud.spanner_admin_database_v1.types.EncryptionInfo):
            Output only. The encryption information for
            the backup.
        encryption_information (MutableSequence[google.cloud.spanner_admin_database_v1.types.EncryptionInfo]):
            Output only. The encryption information for the backup,
            whether it is protected by one or more KMS keys. The
            information includes all Cloud KMS key versions used to
            encrypt the backup. The
            ``encryption_status' field inside of each``\ EncryptionInfo\`
            is not populated. At least one of the key versions must be
            available for the backup to be restored. If a key version is
            revoked in the middle of a restore, the restore behavior is
            undefined.
        database_dialect (google.cloud.spanner_admin_database_v1.types.DatabaseDialect):
            Output only. The database dialect information
            for the backup.
        referencing_backups (MutableSequence[str]):
            Output only. The names of the destination backups being
            created by copying this source backup. The backup names are
            of the form
            ``projects/<project>/instances/<instance>/backups/<backup>``.
            Referencing backups may exist in different instances. The
            existence of any referencing backup prevents the backup from
            being deleted. When the copy operation is done (either
            successfully completed or cancelled or the destination
            backup is deleted), the reference to the backup is removed.
        max_expire_time (google.protobuf.timestamp_pb2.Timestamp):
            Output only. The max allowed expiration time of the backup,
            with microseconds granularity. A backup's expiration time
            can be configured in multiple APIs: CreateBackup,
            UpdateBackup, CopyBackup. When updating or copying an
            existing backup, the expiration time specified must be less
            than ``Backup.max_expire_time``.
        backup_schedules (MutableSequence[str]):
            Output only. List of backup schedule URIs
            that are associated with creating this backup.
            This is only applicable for scheduled backups,
            and is empty for on-demand backups.

            To optimize for storage, whenever possible,
            multiple schedules are collapsed together to
            create one backup. In such cases, this field
            captures the list of all backup schedule URIs
            that are associated with creating this backup.
            If collapsing is not done, then this field
            captures the single backup schedule URI
            associated with creating this backup.
        incremental_backup_chain_id (str):
            Output only. Populated only for backups in an incremental
            backup chain. Backups share the same chain id if and only if
            they belong to the same incremental backup chain. Use this
            field to determine which backups are part of the same
            incremental backup chain. The ordering of backups in the
            chain can be determined by ordering the backup
            ``version_time``.
        oldest_version_time (google.protobuf.timestamp_pb2.Timestamp):
            Output only. Data deleted at a time older
            than this is guaranteed not to be retained in
            order to support this backup. For a backup in an
            incremental backup chain, this is the version
            time of the oldest backup that exists or ever
            existed in the chain. For all other backups,
            this is the version time of the backup. This
            field can be used to understand what data is
            being retained by the backup system.
        instance_partitions (MutableSequence[google.cloud.spanner_admin_database_v1.types.BackupInstancePartition]):
            Output only. The instance partition(s) storing the backup.

            This is the same as the list of the instance partition(s)
            that the database had footprint in at the backup's
            ``version_time``.

            A filter expression consists of a field name, a comparison
            operator, and a value for filtering. The value must be a
            string, a number, or a boolean. The comparison operator must
            be one of: ``<``, ``>``, ``<=``, ``>=``, ``!=``, ``=``, or
            ``:``. Colon ``:`` is the contains operator. Filter rules
            are not case sensitive.

            The following fields in the
            [Backup][google.spanner.admin.database.v1.Backup] are
            eligible for filtering:

            combined with AND logic, but you can specify AND, OR, and
            NOT logic explicitly.

            Here are a few examples:

            -  ``name:Howl`` - The backup's name contains the string
               "howl".
            -  ``database:prod`` - The database's name contains the

               ``create_time`` of the backup is before
               2018-03-28T14:50:00Z.
            -  ``expire_time < \"2018-03-28T14:50:00Z\"`` - The backup
               ``expire_time`` is before 2018-03-28T14:50:00Z.
            -  ``size_bytes > 10000000000`` - The backup's size is
               greater than 10GB
