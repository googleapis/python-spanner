            operation. Name of the database from which this backup was
            created. This needs to be in the same instance as the
            backup. Values are of the form
            ``projects/<project>/instances/<instance>/databases/<database>``.
        expire_time (~.timestamp.Timestamp):
            Required for the
            [CreateBackup][google.spanner.admin.database.v1.DatabaseAdmin.CreateBackup]

            microseconds granularity that must be at least 6 hours and
            at most 366 days from the time the CreateBackup request is
            processed. Once the ``expire_time`` has passed, the backup
            is eligible to be automatically deleted by Cloud Spanner to
            free the resources used by the backup.

            [UpdateBackup][google.spanner.admin.database.v1.DatabaseAdmin.UpdateBackup]
            operation.

            A globally unique identifier for the backup which cannot be

            The final segment of the name must be between 2 and 60
            characters in length.

            The backup is stored in the location(s) specified in the
            instance configuration of the instance containing the

            ``projects/<project>/instances/<instance>/databases/<database>``.
            Referencing databases may exist in different instances. The
            existence of any referencing database prevents the backup
            from being deleted. When a restored database from the backup
            enters the ``READY`` state, the reference to the backup is

            A filter expression consists of a field name, a comparison

            string, a number, or a boolean. The comparison operator must
            be one of: ``<``, ``>``, ``<=``, ``>=``, ``!=``, ``=``, or
            ``:``. Colon ``:`` is the contains operator. Filter rules
