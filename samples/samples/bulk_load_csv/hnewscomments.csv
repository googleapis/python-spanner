By announcing that they were giving back money to their shareholders, they opened the door for savvy stock market gurus.  These guys milked it for all it was worth by first loading up on the stock in order to get the cash from the dividends.  Because all these people were buying the stock, its price became artificially inflated, so they proceeded to borrow against the stock at this point (in order to short-sell later).  Then the dividends came, and they got the $3/share from Microsoft.  Immediately after this, they proceeded to sell the stocks that got them the dividends, which led to the stock price falling sharply.  Finally, to round it all out, they proceeded to make good on the short-sells once the stocks were low, leading to a nice profit all-around.<p>I wish I remembered where I read about this scheme; it sounded pretty brilliant to me.

The reason I am posting this here is: I had such high hopes for you to be a different kind of corporation. - to be able to make the transition from cool startup to cool company. - not to be evil ;-). That's not how I see you now.<p>First of all, how and why does a company that was started by two guys without a PhD so strongly favorise PhDs when it comes to the recruitement for all research and other ""cool"" positions. I am halfway through on my own PhD in CS, and  honestly I just don't see your point. I mean a PhD is not a magical transformation into a creativity boasting super- hack-thing. Au contraire, I wonder how you are able to keep your engine running with so many PhDs around. There is some truth to the stereotype of the slightly mad and sometimes overly complicated CS academic person. I experience that daily. And then statements like: ""We want to hire people who are smarter than those already working for us"". Just hire people that have amazing skills, are cool, and enthusiastic. That's what you were built on. Please don't just look at GPA and titles.<p>Second and that applies not only to you but to all search engine companies, please stop giving us the impression that you know what's going on with your algorithm. Come on there are billions of documents on the Web - and you have an algorithm that ranks those according to millions of different queries. So please tell me - how do you figure out if your algorithm is doing it's job? How? It's all educated guessing. Nothing more. <p>Third, please G get over it with the ""Do not be evil thing"". AOL might have had an employee unfortunately release a dataset, but at least they allow you to delete all your personal data. While you do not, and boast about   anonymizing our data after several years. And yes you censor in China, and I also remember the story about your employee who you fired for blogging that you are actually not as cool as he imagined you. Yahoo and MS do stuff like this too, but at least they don't pretend to be saints.<p>And fourth. Please your marketing hype about being different, being still like a startup - you overplay it. You going green, and the sudden popularity of that - a mere coincidence? And yes - sue microsoft for being monopolistic - but at the same time acquire doubleclick and argue it's ok?<p>Ah, dear G. it might just be that I worked too much and yes I only slept 6 hours in the last three days.

They are absolutely the kings of hot-fixes/service packs and absolutely the kings of keeping backwards compatibility wherever possible, which is about all you can ask for.<p>2) Let's not pretend like Internet Explorer wasn't a huge product for Microsoft (and the world). There's nothing worth arguing there. As for the web 2.0 stuff, Microsoft has demonstrated that it's not going to be a pioneer here (and it isn't in many businesses, actually). That said, they're making money from their search product, and MSN/Live.com is still quite popular. I don't know what metrics you want to judge Microsoft by here, but if they're behind it's not to the point of death. Especially since we still haven't seen any billion-dollar ideas out of web 2.0 (short of ad platform stuff a la Google, whic MSFT is copying).<p>3) When has Microsoft really had that many friends in the first place? They run a business that's especially large, so they'll be stepping on toes all over the place. I'm not entirely sure how this points to their ultimate demise, so long as they're still making more money than the competition is... (That means they're winning)<p>4) You only need one cash cow (ask Google). Microsoft has two clear clear money winners. The rest of the products are ultimately investments more than anything, but I'll go one by one just for fun. MSN is indeed taking over web search share recently, and has always had a super popular destination page and email. The Zune didn't beat the iPod, but neither is anything else. For a first try, the Zune actually didn't suck too hard. Microsoft is working their way into the consumer entertainment space here, though, is the real point. The surface computer isn't a real product, so I don't think anyone's bought it. MS research kicks out a lot of stuff that's just worth thinking about, not worth making. IIS is a pretty popular web server. It's not free though, so Apache makes for pretty tough competition. Ultimately, IIS is more a part of MS's entire web stack, and so if you buy into that, you're giving MSFT a lot of money, which is good, even if it's not #1. The Xbox, again, is a consumer entertainment play, and the Xbox 360's killing it in the US console market. Microsoft has a lot of money, and they throw it around. You don't have to win markets to make money, and they know that fact well.<p>5) It's way too early to tell for sure, but if XP's launch is any basis for comparison, Vista has some great years ahead. We'll see how the Vista hate keeps up when people realize it's, like XP is now, the standard OS everyone's running. Even if Mac OS tripled up, its share would still be basically irrelevant to MSFT's bottom line.<p>6) Compare Microsoft's stock price to Ford's over the last few years. Both companies are such long-standing giants that there's no excitement to be had in trading the stock. If you don't buy that, you could at least accept that if confidence in Microsoft were tanking, the stock would be too. It's actually up 10% on the year. <p>7) PC makers aren't turning their backs on Microsoft. They're trying to pick up some sales from the Microsoft haters (who they would prefer not also become Dell haters by association). Dell is gaining customers with the deal, and Microsoft's not losing any (since Dell buys the licenses, not the buyer). This is as much of a non-point as the rest.","1188801575","2007-09-03T06:39:35Z"

The dude is wrong. <p>By the way, isn't anyone else tired of this endless ""shift to services"" BS that we've been fed by tech-media since around year 2000? And even if it's a ""shift"" indeed, as opposed to just another possible option, isn't Microsoft in the best position to simply start charging everybody $XX/mo for Vista subscription? <p>Microsoft does have its problems, but they certainly have nothing to do with their business model or ""lack of friends"". As much as I dislike their products these days, nobody else managed to charge people for software as much as they did (and still do). Almost everybody else, having failed to produce something valuable enough to have users pay them money, is busy deciding on the same lame question: ""shall we put the ads up or we still have enough cash to wait until someone acquires us?"" The business is simple: make something people want and they will pay you. Either up front or monthly - is it really that important?<p>Every point he makes is either invalid or plain stupid. How can one say that ""Microsoft is doomed because their stock isn't rising anymore""? He is confusing a reason with consequence.

However Microsoft also has strong leverage over Xobni as it controls what components work with Outlook. So this scenario of an aggressive Microsoft being rebuffed by a confident startup does not sound plausible.<p>Scenario b) Microsoft is timing its acquisition. If Xobni is independent, it could possibly integrate its service with other webmail providers. These providers (like Google or AOL) would be very reluctant to let a Microsoft owned Xobni have access to their users. In this case, by delaying the acquisition Microsoft could be hoping to gain leverage over the other email companies once their users are hooked on Xobni. Something along these lines seems much more plausible to me.<p>A third scenario comes to mind: Microsoft realizes that its history of acquisitions has not been too great, and it thinks Xobni is too important to risk screwing up this way. This seems unlikely just based on everything I've read and heard about the company and its culture.","1203397257","2008-02-19T05:00:57Z"

If Xobni was an independent (though Microsoft controlled) entity, every enterprise Xobni user would willingly pay for Xobni and have to still pay for Outlook. Further depending on the utility of Xobni to users, they could charge more than Outlook itself!

1. What is the long term roadmap for Xobni? 
2. Will merging with MSFT slow down innovation?<p>and the most important question<p>3. What is the <i>right</i> acquisition price for Xobni?<p><pre><code>       Xobni roughly raised 4.25 million Series A. At that time they probably had a decent prototype to demo at Khosla ventures -- which means that (pure speculation) 20-35% of the company is owned by the VC's. Ideally the VC's would like to make roughly 3-10X of their investment, which means 15 to 45 million.

       From Adam and Matt's perspective, they have a winner on their hands, and they would want to maximize their ROI on selling Xobni and make sure they never have to work again:-). The longer they wait, the more users they get. And, clearly their pace of innovation is going to be faster than msft.
</code></pre>
From MSFT's perspective:
1. Does Xobni have enough users? 
2. How frequently do people use Xobni?

This gives Yahoo an awesome position (at least for short term) with huge multiple benefits,such as #1 it can get best of the best deal possible either from google or MS (doesn't really matter who as far as good money shows up in yahoo's bank account), #2 these negotiations will put a speed breaker on Carl Ichan's bid for getting a new board (remember shareholder meeting is not far away, again it is all about timing) #3 if any deal is announced (whether with google or MS) before shareholder's meeting then yahoo's stock price will go up for sure and the chances are Carl Ichan will soften his position, #4 the deal (with google or ms) will make everyone happy with win win situation for all 3 important yahoo stake-holders (employees, end-users and shareholders) and #5 the biggest of all is if yahoo and google get in to a deal then stock prices will go up and yahoo will be then able to justify why they didn't budge to sell the company to MS - also now if at all MS wants to buy yahoo (even after a year) then they have to bow down to the price that yahoo wants, also remember this deal (between yahoo and google) will also make all 3 stake-holders happy.

The G phone is for development purposes, but I like to switch to the G phone for short periods of time so that I get to use it and have a feel of how it works and to use my own apps. What this means is that I'm doing a 3-way sync and I'm am rather concern that a single point of failure will wipe everything out.<p>I also disliked the fact that I can't sync my photos and music over to the G phone automatically.<p>I'm not sure if there's a good solution for this, but maybe a synchronising problem like this is begging for a startup to solve (something like MobileMe but platform-agnostic with hooks into different platforms and apps?)","1234209896","2009-02-09T20:04:56Z"

Their previous ""I'm a PC"" and ""Seinfeld"" ads have been terrible - trying to convince us that their computers were cool or every-day machines against Apple's bourgeois style.  Those were stupid.<p>These ads drive to the heart of the issue - many people want something Apple doesn't sell (or doesn't sell at a price they can afford).  Microsoft has hit Apple where it counts and that's why these ads are great - and I say that typing from my MacBook Pro.  I really don't think this should get into a Macs vs PCs are more expensive argument - those never end well.  What I can say is that PCs offer more choice - you can get a 17"" PC laptop without having to buy the most expensive processor and the like.  In Apple's world, all upgrades come in tandem with things you may or may not want and that makes certain things (like a 17"" screen) start at a whopping $2,800.<p>I'm a programmer.  My computer is my livelihood and I'm going to pay up for something because I use it so much.  However, Microsoft's ads hit home for many people who go looking for a computer on a budget and don't want to come home with a 13"" laptop when they wanted a 15"" one - and might not need some of the other things in a MacBook.  If your budget is $1,500, the only Mac laptop you can get is the MacBook 13"".  It's a tight spot for many people buying computers.<p>And this ad puts that tight spot on the screen.  It's not going to convince me to buy a PC, but it's going to get others thinking about the features they want and the availability of those features in Macs at a price they'll accept.  Again, I hope this doesn't start a Mac vs PC price crap thing because it's really about the customization - aka, why do I need to buy a 2.66GHz processor to get a 17"" screen?","1239380987","2009-04-10T16:29:47Z"

It wouldn't surprise me to see support for LTE included as AT&#38;T (and others) will be deploying service heavily in the next 2 years (typical life span of an iPhone?)<p>For Snow Leopard I agree that Apple will probably offer it at a highly reduced price compared to 10.4 or 10.5. There will probably be at least a few surprises we haven't seen yet but nothing that is going to justify a $100+ price for most people. The worst thing that could happen for Apple is for 10.4 &#38; 10.5 to continue lingering around XP style if users don't quickly adopt 10.6. Between lax copy protection and a low price tag Apple could easily move 70-80% of their Intel users to 10.6 within a year. There have been rumors Windows 7 upgrade pricing is going to be quite cheap so Apple has to at least match that price. (both 7 &#38; 10.6 are basically maintenance releases and probably have the same approximate value to consumers)<p>I don't expect any other big surprises.

Give it a halfway decent 3D chip and a simple motion controller (with iPhone/Touch integration too, of course) they could probably capitalize on all the developers doing games for the iPhone market. It may be Apple's last real chance to get a foot hold in the set top market because both Sony &#38; Microsoft are starting to push more and more non-gaming apps out.

When I went to the site I liked the layout and the appearance but I didn't really understand what it was about. So I was not motivated to sign up for an alpha. If more of the site was visible I'd ""get"" it and might want to sign up.<p>Another neat feature would be if I could invite some of my friends.<p>Also it would be nice if I could just interact with it, at least get a basic feel, or get a demo, without the sign-up. That would help me decide whether I wanted to sign up or not.<p>I have noticed in my own ventures is that when I release things and people start using them and sending me feedback that becomes an incredibly powerful source of motivation and energy for me to keep working on the stuff in the evenings and on weekends. The lack of motivation only occurs before the release. So it's good to get the release out of the way quickly -- even if it is a flimsy and pathetic release. Sort of like a newborn baby -- flimsy but functional.<p>If the back-end does not completely work yet, is there a really simple, really tiny scenario that it could implement so that it could be useful? Think minimal and simple and throw out all the elaborate features that you need more people to implement.<p>Another thing I have found useful is to add a feedback form somewhere so that early users can send me direct feedback.

I also remember a picture from ticketstumbler. It took a while to equate <i>""Dan""</i> with <i>""fallentimes""</i>.<p>Firstly it's the sheer bloody waste. The waste of youth, the talent and opportunity. Then there is the betrayal. Betrayal in the sense of abandoning of those who cared, family, friends. It took a bit of time for me to accept <i>""tragedy""</i> as the correct phrase to use here? Tragedy for me is/was reserved for people killed, because they had no other opportunity, no other choice. I've had plenty of time to reflect on <i>""tragedy""</i> this year. I've been to more funeral services this year than I care for and I'll be working on the fallout for years to come ~ <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/bootload/collections/72157621186142971/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.flickr.com/photos/bootload/collections/7215762118...</a> So I can empathise with the situation. I really can.<p>But I now realise the passing of Dan is just as tragic in the true Greek sense for other reasons. It's a tragedy because of all the choices Dan made he chose the one that will do the most damage to himself, his family and friends. It's a tragedy because of the waste of youth, talent and opportunity. Dan's gift to me is he re-enforces the idea of <i>""be good""</i>, <i>""try your best""</i>, <i>""have fun""</i> but gain some perspective of what really matters. I know this is hard in Startups and in youth. Perspective comes with time.<p>Remember this when you fail, when you succeed.

I was so impressed with the strength of Dan's ideas, his natural charisma, and how much of a hustler he was. I still tell friends the stories I heard from him that day about how he worked the system in ways that I don't think even Dan would feel comfortable with me saying here. Dan worked all the angles, especially the ones that you and I would never even consider. He took crazy risks, often came out on top, and had a shit-eating grin the whole way. Dan was awesome. Throughout the summer, Dan and I would talk regularly about our companies, strategies, and how it was going. He had the rare mix of smart, incisive questions, and an easygoing manner that made everyone relax and smile. Jessica would always scold Dan and Tom for drinking too much beer in front of the speakers, and Dan would always charm his way out. Everyone was in stitches for his demo day presentations too. I remember hearing PG brag about feeling like he could just leave the TicketStumblers alone and they'd come up with something awesome without his help.<p>Dan was an amazing guy, and I only saw a tiny fraction of his light.

I was kinda new to the whole thing, and even with such a newbie, Dan always took the time to answer every question, explain every concept, letting me know about problems I will come across, and how to deal with them. It always shocked me how much time he took to help me out. I had only met him through the #startups channel, so we were virtual strangers.<p>From my minimal interactions with Dan, he seemed like a genuine dude. The phrase 'a real stand up guy' comes to mind as well. He just gave off that vibe and it seems that tons of others here picked up on that vibe as well. The best thing to do is to take a page out of Dan's book in how to treat others, and be selfless, and spread that. I know I'll try.<p>We didn't know each other too well, Dan, but cheers to you, man.

Computers used to JUST be these beige boxes that sat under our desks.  Actually at one point, it used to be huge mainframes.  Now, computers are everywhere, and by computers I mean full fledged system specific GUIs tied to some piece of hardware.  They're in our pocket, in our cars, on our desks, in our laps, on our tvs, in the cloud as servers, and probably other places I'm not naming.  This is where I see other Operating Systems taking away Microsoft's dinner.  Microsoft got us to the first billion, but I'm pretty sure someone else will get us to the first trillion.  Now, that's pretty exciting.<p>As far as the desktop goes?  Apple will have its market share, which is the high end computing market (they have ~90% of it that 10%) and windows will have the other 90%.  You can make Ubuntu function/look exactly like windows/mac.  The problem comes down to the OEMs.  Will they support it?  Will they make the strong push in marketing to get people to try it out?  Your grandmother is not going to do sudo and apt-get commands.  If an OEM made beautiful machines, that ran tight software/hardware integration running a customized version of Ubuntu, marketed the hell out of it, and offered the right amount of training like Apple does, it could possibly get off the ground.  Even then, linux is a scary place for the average person and the apps just aren't there.<p>Honestly, I'm more bullish on other Operating Systems taking us from billions to trillions on devices that aren't beige boxes that sit under our desk.","1258642823","2009-11-19T15:00:23Z"

Yes, M$ had gained such stature, and Bill such celebrity, that many a blind eye was turned toward their technology, marketing practices, and other less-than-wonderful aspects.<p>Today, Google (peer'd by Apple) is the new Microsoft (IBM is the new General Motors, but that's a different topic).

“Corporations” in the simplest sense are just groups of people acting together (usually towards shared goals). This is not bad or evil in and of itself. “Corporatism” as I would define it is the partnership/collusion between some of these groups and the state.<p>I do not believe we can or should stop cooperation between people, and placing limits on which actions cooperating groups are allowed to take is just as wrong as placing those restrictions on the people themselves.<p>There are many, many things wrong with the way we treat corporations here today, but this usually has to do with the privilege granted to many to be free from law and regulation that individuals and other groups of individuals who are not in partnership with the state are bound by.<p>*Edited to fix a typo.","1264196808","2010-01-22T21:46:48Z"

given that, i don't think i would be interested in running any arbitrary program on it. i would prefer my computer for doing that. apple store thus becomes more of a alternate clearing-house of published information. i am probably more concerned about some fundamental erosion of fair-use-rights here than anything else, as building strict copyright controls on such a device is probably much simpler .

"1250788","rit","rit",,,"1250595","1","Interesting.<p>MonoTouch, which is the Novell/Mono team's rather fantastic port of C#/.Net to iPhone, compiles down to native code and apparently that was OK with apple to begin with. Unity3D which is a popular 3d framework for many platforms including iPhone (Where it runs a lot of games) was available before MonoTouch and is Mono based.<p>Assuming the OP is correct in the ""new developer license agreement"" statement (e.g. the relevant section is entirely new or changed) the ""Originally written in Objective-C, C, C++ or JavaScript"" is worrisome.  It technically invalidates MonoTouch.  Even if MonoTouch is hard translating code to One of the blessed languages before compile, you didn't write it ORIGINALLY in it.<p>And love or hate Mono, .Net, C#, etc etc. the fact is that it brings iPhone development to a larger audience which is (IMHO) overall good for the iPhone app world.<p>I seem to recall Adobe was demoing a similar system a few months back - which would compile down a Flash app to native code in more or less the same way as MonoTouch does.  I guess it's entirely possible that Apple is targeting this in their change, but unlikely as this wouldn't allow you to run downloaded flash.  It would simply let you download Apps from the store which were written for Flash, but since they'd been translated to native runtime probably wouldn't be the battery hogs that apple seems to fear.<p>I've been watching Apple long enough to think this may not be a case where they're targeting a specific person/company, rather ... it's future leverage.  If they run up against something they don't like (there are obviously lots of things like MonoTouch and more coming along) sometime in the future they now have a clear one liner to point at for ""VERBOTEN"".  They may still however work happily with companies like Novell to produce a grey-area inhabiting MonoTouch.<p>UPDATE: For the record, the MonoTouch FAQ (<a href=""http://monotouch.net/FAQ"" rel=""nofollow"">http://monotouch.net/FAQ</a>) states very clearly ""MonoTouch is delivered as a static compiler that turns .NET executables and libraries into native applications.

That Apple merely took the gloves off and started taking the fight more seriously. But aggrieved sentiment is written all over Steve Jobs's reaction to Android.<p>'They want to kill the iPhone' -- remember that little gem? How did he know this? Because Android-based products were looking more and more like iPhones. But the reason for the convergent evolution of the two platforms is quite obvious: it's a winning design. It's a ridiculous justification for preemptive retaliation, on par with 'Saddam tried to kill my daddy'.<p>The reason Google decided to get involved in smartphones is the same reason Apple did: the internet. Before the current sheer-slab-of-touchscreen became the recognised form-factor of an internet-friendly phone, we waited years and years for Nokia, SE and Motorola and crucially, the carriers, to give us a device that could freely access the services and content that we knew were all around us. What did we get? Push email. The pressure was building and by 2005 the industry was ripe for disruption.<p>Apple's prestige, combined with the exclusive AT&#38;T deal, was what forced the carriers to abandon their walled-garden ideal and take the internet seriously. The iPhone was an offer they couldn't refuse. Google could not have done that. The problem is that having freed us from the carriers' walled gardens, Apple now wants to take their place.<p>I think Jobs was being just a little disingenuous when he said Google wants to kill the iPhone. What he could have more honestly and accurately said is that Google wants to kill the iPhone OS's chance of achieving a monopoly position. Why do they want that? For the same reason they got into smartphone design: the internet.","1276684136","2010-06-16T10:28:56Z"

They genuinely seem to feel enormously betrayed by it.  What this tells me is that both of them are now starting to acknowledge internally that Android really is an enormous threat to the iPhone and it is so in ways that they simply can't compete with.  Google is putting out an operating system that is nearly as good as Apple's, runs on any hardware that anyone wants it to and is completely free.   Apple can't hurt Google by undermining it profits because it doesn't make the hardware and it gives the software away.   It really seems like an unfair fight.  But what I think really hurts is Google invalidates Apple's core thesis, that control, power and lockdown are necessary for a consumer friendly operating system. Right as Apple is trying to justify not including Flash by saying it can't work properly on phones, Google is there adding it into Android and making them look like fools.<p>Incidentally Gruber seems to be conveniently overlooking a lot of history here.  Hostilities really started when <i>Apple</i> banned Google Voice from the iPhone.  Prior to that things were pretty friendly, but after that Google realized it couldn't afford to play friendly with Apple - so they enabled multitouch in Android and things went downhill from there.   Although it's a completely pointless and silly game to play if you really follow it back I think there is a very good argument that Apple started this whole falling out.","1276685399","2010-06-16T10:49:59Z"

Android took a shot at RIM by focusing on gmail integration and a great email experience (including frequent polling to get the same effect as push email) to the detriment of other areas of the user experience. It didn't have a focus on corporate, but they also knew that more and more people were using traditionally personal email services for business purposes (and they did know immediately that it was necessary and were working on exchange support). While they still had room to improve the email experience, they provided what many considered the best mobile email experience from the G1 onward. They then continued to improve everything else in the direction of the industry bests, which yes included UI inspiration from iphone.<p>Also, the idea that early hardware used for developing software is any indication of the ultimate direction is ridiculous.

However, there are numerous overriding benefits of open source software.<p>#1: Startup founders use technology they know. Open source developers tend to be willing to trade more risk and effort for a more tailored and flexible end product. This is a similar personality profile to someone who's willing to put in a large amount of work to build a business and potentially get nothing for it. Microsoft builds run-of-the-mill, sure-thing products that will at least do something well, and they'll support it for you. Commercial software dictates their software model: take few risks and sell to broadest audience.<p>#2: Interoperability. Microsoft software works outstandingly well with other Microsoft software. Open source software tends to be built on open standards, and, again, if you have the source, it's always possible to hack it together. The open nature means less business risk when making software decisions. The way out is of a situation where software won't do what you need it to do is to use the source, even if only as a temporary patch.<p>#3: Automation. While things are getting better, it's still much easier to automate most open source software, since these products usually either have a CLI, an API, or even in the worst case scenario: source code.<p>#4: Even with BizSpark, licensing has limits on your companies' use of technology. Simple example: Do we go with a bunch of small boxes or a few large boxes? Licensing concern may drive your team to fundamentally flawed architecture decisions.","1280345668","2010-07-28T19:34:28Z"

Don't make a technical decision based on the job market either: that's an argument commonly used for Blub. If you have a cool and interesting project, people will not mind learning a different language to join you, even if they're mostly hobbyists who would never touch MS Software on their own.<p>There are some caveats, however: you should have a solid  reason why you're using this product (""it's what I know how to program"" or ""it's easy to hire for"" is not; ""we have a large codebase and we can't just stop feature development and do a re-write"" is), it has to the an acceptable tool for the job (e.g., you're not doing machine learning in PHP) and you have to be flexible enough to use other tools when they're right for the job (e.g., Facebook writing services in C++ when needed vs. forcing everyone to work exclusively in PHP). If you fit these criteria, you'll be able to hire hackers (although I personally wouldn't join a company that required me to run Windows on the desktop, which is very likely to be the case if your product is on .NET).<p>Now as for why I don't use MS tools:<p>F# is pretty amazing and C# is fairly bearable compared to other languages in Blub Central (of course it's still a Blub). If Mono were more usable for the server side, I'd be writing projects in those two languages. I'd very seriously consider Gtk# or Cocoa# + Mono for writing a desktop application (as opposed to using C++ + Qt or Java/Scala + Swing/SWT). Nonetheless, Mono is just not (yet) usable for a server.<p>I'd flatly refuse to use Windows for either a server or a development machine as it's simply an environment designed for the masses and <i>not</i> for hackers. I am many times more productive with Perl/Python UNIX shell + Terminal than I am with a GUI and Powershell (which is a lot better than the Microsoft tools I grew up with).<p>If Microsoft actually targeted hackers and developers as opposed to IT departments of non-technical firms I'd consider their products. Problem is that they're not a charity, but a corporation with a legal obligation to generate profit for their shareholders. Their current strategy works well for them and I don't see that changing. When I see a company using a proprietary stack, I <i>first</i> assume that the company is mostly ""business guys"" and wants warm bodies. I'll have to convinced otherwise, which is possibly; I am not close minded: you can't just judge people by the architectural decisions they made without knowing <i>why</i> the made them.<p>I am glad to see Microsoft support F# and Scala on .NET, but I am not sure how far this will go.

It seems like a joke, but if you think about it, professional car service drivers aren't going to want to pick up just anybody for short rides. That's the real obstacle for scalability among that group. The obstacle for getting all cab drivers to join UberCab is probably the risk of alienating the customer base that might just want town cars, etc., without having to think about the complexity (i.e., it's a software problem, and a pretty easy software problem if done right). The other obstacle is the cost of an iphone, etc., for cab drivers. The obstacles for anybody with a car to join are medallions, licenses, etc., as mentioned. The other obstacle is, even with licenses, the fairness and effectiveness of the rating system is tough. Service history is a mixed blessing. When I step into a cab, I may not actually want to know about the driver's history. I may just want a nearly 100% guaranteed level of service (which theoretically the medallions provide). Though on the other hand it would be crazy to see like average on-time trips, average speeds, customer satisfactions, etc., in one big visual thumbprint before you step into a cab...","1283274272","2010-08-31T17:04:32Z"

Algorithms change without notice, different data centers return different results, the rest of the Internet changes constantly, and there's no control Google.

One can reasonably argue that those people don't matter, but they can't with a straight face suggest that a ""pledge of support"" in any way mitigates the problem.<p>There's nothing wrong with this post as a contribution to the WebM/H.264 Apple/Google debate.

Off the top of my head, they include: Visual Studio Web Developer Express, SQL Server Express, IIS Express (which is IIS stand-alone, but bundled with WebMatrix, so don't hold your breath for a stand-alone distributable of IIS, which would be real awesome).<p>Recently, MS released the Web Platform Installer WPI, which is a master installer that checks for the existence of IIS, .NET 2,3.5&#38;4, ASP.NET, ASP.NET MVC, SQL Server Express, then installs and configures those applications if they are not there. It actually works most of the time, and does a good job registering ASP.NET into IIS.<p>Additionally, the WPI will read a default RSS feed from MS, which publishes popular Open Source IIS applications, like CMS, Blog and ECommerce systems. WPI can be configured to read third-party RSS feeds. These applications are installed with default settings, or really the settings they had when a developer used MS's web deployment wizard, or web package builder to create them -- dig too deep into this technology, and you'll get woozy quick.<p>Having spent a month building an installer for an enterprise ASP.NET application, and watching it fail 50% of the time due to ACL restrictions, I can say that WPI and it's deployment packages are an ambitious task, and they've done pretty well.<p>Now, MS has an package manager for OSS projects called NuGet, which is like apt-get, I suppose. I've seen it begin to crop up on git hub. Hard core OSSers will find this all odd: a whole ecosystem being built and advocated by MS, around open source software which will, Mono aside, only run on closed MS operating systems. Let's face it, if it weren't for internal big-corp enterprise software, ASP.NET would have a much less prevalent developer base then it does now. I can't see internal enterprise projects being managed like they are OSS projects: running their own RSS feeds for packages and NuGet servers for library dependences, so I don't know how popular NuGet will become, but many of these new technologies do make my day job easier.","1294973036","2011-01-14T02:43:56Z"

  --------------------------------

  Speaking of Palm CEO Ed Colligan, now’s a good time
  to recall his comments from last November, regarding
  the prospects of Apple’s then-only-rumored entry into
  the mobile phone market:

  &#62; Colligan laughed off the idea that any company — 
  &#62; including the wildly popular Apple Computer — 
  &#62; could easily win customers in the finicky smart-phone
  &#62; sector.

  &#62; “We’ve learned and struggled for a few years here
  &#62; figuring out how to make a decent phone,” he said.
  &#62; “PC guys are not going to just figure this out.
  &#62; They’re not going to just walk in.”

Combining our PREfix team with some really good people from Microsoft Research moved the technology forward a lot faster than we would have otherwise -- and tech transferring the stripped-down version of PREfast into Visual Studio put it in the hands of a lot of users across the world.

But, Just because a Mercedes is being compared to a Honda doesn't mean that there's some sort of a class issue at stake.<p>Honda is a fantastic engineering company. In terms of drivetrain technology they are right up there with the very best (for lower capacity engines, I'd say they are better than Mercedes, but I digress). However, Mercedes  (especially till the early nineties) was about attention to detail, not just the drivetrain, but each and every part that went in, was famously ""over-engineered"". If I may, my interpretation of the analogy:<p>a. Honda's focus is on the engineering (drivetrain to be specific), they are willing to do an average (nothing special, but not bad) job for the rest of the package. That includes average interiors, average ride quality, average styling etc.<p>b. Mercedes tries (or did try) to do a stellar job in each of those categories listed above.<p>So, if Android is Google's engineering, Google let's Samsung get away with a plasticky phone (I have used the Galaxy nexus for an hour and a half today). Yes, even now the feel of the phone in one's hand is not even comparable to the iPhone 4.<p>But the analogy falls flat because the Galaxy Nexus is more expensive on contract than the iPhone. Price matters, the pricing helps Mercedes devote resources to develop the products the way they do.<p>Gruber, got this wrong too. His own quote ""You either see it or you don’t. If you don’t, that’s cool, enjoy your Nexus. "" is correct, but it's correct on it's own, not with MGs quote.","1323982083","2011-12-15T20:48:03Z"

Most people view jacking up rates on captive customers when the cost of service hasn't increased as immoral.  (See for example <i>Thinking, Fast and Slow</i> by Kahneman.)  The average person views this as price-gouging.<p>But even if you decide that yes, your business is going to operate that way and screw your image, making someone solve a math problem with a half-dozen variables in their head to have some idea of the cost of their ride is not acceptable.  Uber's lawyers should look up cases where someone tried to bury a (""and then the cost increases by 900%"") clause in a contract and those contracts get rejected by the courts.  There's no actual meeting of the minds on the price of the service, and thus the contract is invalid.<p>Uber would do a lot better to add a surcharge: ""Currently there is a $50 surcharge for New Year's Eve in addition to the regular fees.

Most of my friends were still in college but I had already had my startup running. It was early enough in the dot com era that my business was designed to make money, so I had a decent amount of cash in comparison to my universally impoverished university buddies.<p>Anyhow, my best friends were throwing this weekend house party where all the local freaks, geeks, and hipsters would be in attendance. So when my best friend called me to convince me to come in for the party that weekend, for whatever reason, I had this dumb idea. Perhaps this was a harbinger of the pre-dot-com opulence to come and the idea, of course, was on a much smaller scale but nevertheless, for no reason whatsoever except that I had for the first time in my life a bunch of cash burning a hole in my pocket, I suggested we get a mariachi band for the party. My friend looked into it. He found a group. He told me the amount for the basic band. I forget what was going to cost $250 extra to bring along as a musician (maybe an extra trumpet) but it all seemed very worth it. We needed the proper instrumentation represented.<p>When the band arrived with the party in full swing, they were pretty freaked out, since, this was not the normal kind of gig they played; no, not collage parties. So the woman dealing with the thing asked for half the cash up front. She also upped the price a bunch from the initial agreed upon amount but I didn't care. I was really just looking forward to seeing them play near the tapped keg around a bunch of mystified acquaintances. Now if I could have only gotten this done for $100, I would have filled the whole house with competing acts that night. Great work Über and thanks for bring back a fond memory.","1335907667","2012-05-01T21:27:47Z"

"3994081","siglesias","siglesias",,,"3993649","0","Trying hard to see the rationale behind this split. Gruber's emphasis has always been on ""quality,"" ""being the best,"" and ""being right"" in everything he does. Thus the only light through which I can see this decision is his belief that the show is better without Dan. Their relationship throughout The Talk Show has had its tumultuous moments: in early episodes, Benjamin's using an Android phone drew Gruber's ire, and then later there was animosity when Benjamin would show up for the Bond episodes unprepared. Gruber would accuse Dan of ""yeah yeahing"" his co-hosts and contributing little in the way of earnest dissent.<p>On the other hand, I always had the sense that Benjamin regarded Gruber as a kneejerk Apple apologist, and this too could not have helped their relationship.<p>But their differences led to the show's magic. Their contrasting styles would turn the show into a focused, intimate meditation on Gruber's thoughts on industry (plus side interests of baseball, Kubrick, etc.), often serving as a preview of what written work would be to come on Daring Fireball. While it can come across as aloofness, Dan has the passive ability to subtly guide the conversation and give it some sense of structure, and he's great at knowing when to let the other person speak. There were also incredibly funny moments of East Coast camaraderie that would keep the side topics interesting and lively.<p>It seems that Gruber has taken all of this for granted in deciding his show is better without Benjamin.

(Though I'm hesitant to call John a blogger because he rarely writes original content. 95% of DF is links or quotes with one sentence of analysis, but that's neither here nor there) Dalrymple was only the second blogger, and Gruber must have felt that Jim was stealing his thunder.<p>Frankly, I think it's for the best.

Never would have guessed it was between the hosts but the magic wasn't there anymore. It seemed more like a chore. I missed the Bond stuff a lot, and was looking forward to the potential next movie club but it never happened. And then things just seemed to become more and more pauses and more and more wasted hours.<p>Another thing: Gruber's a terrible host. Don't get me wrong, I think the man is great, his blog fantastic, a magnificent writer, and a really smart guy. But his constant pauses, breaks, and seeming unwillingness to be on a show doesn't make for good listening. Which is why Dan was KEY to the show. Having him to help guide the conversation, reel Gruber back in, and most importantly, feed him the softballs so Gruber could knock them out of the park was KEY to the success of the show.<p>I just don't understand how Gruber can expect to do the show without him. Now maybe if part of this was because of bad blood, and Gruber is joined by his friends it won't matter, he will WANT to talk to them and it wont be an issue. But I don't know.<p>All in all, I'm not sure I'm going to keep listening. Gruber &#38; Friends only interests me if the friends are the aforementioned Lonely Sandwich, or Merlin, or other guys who's shows and insight I've come to know and love.<p>As for the reasoning? Your guess is as good as mine, and I think people are right in assuming it's bad blood otherwise an official statement should have come from someone. To be fair, as respect to the fans and people who listen one, if not both should have said something (Leo Laporte is very open when his shows/hosts move on) because it's the professional thing to do. If the split is personal not professional the silence makes more sense. That said, these guys make themselves out to be professional so even if it <i>was</i> personal they should still have come out an said something (again, see Laporte).<p>One thing is for certain. Listen to Dan's back and forth with hosts like Siracusa, Dalrymple, and of course Merlin Mann. Merlin <i>signs off</i> with an ""I Love You"" and you can tell there's a genuine friendship amongst that professional relationship. Gruber and Dan never had that, so maybe its for the best they go their separate ways.<p>But for both to say nothing to anyone is a big Screw You to the fans (note I only used screw to be polite, I would have opted for the harsher option), and doesn't leave me wanting to hear Talk Show 3.0.<p>I'll still read Daring Fireball religiously though.","1337445438","2012-05-19T16:37:18Z"

It is a reasonable danger to these services, there are so many unknowns. The reason why the cab business is regulated in the first place was for public safety, so that cab drivers wouldn't just ask for exorbitant prices, take your luggage hostage etc. Remember, you are still just jumping into a stranger's car. Regulation was introduced to remedy these concerns (I'm not saying they are effective)<p>Airbnb shows how regulation is a reasonable concern. Once you go beyond the early adopters, there are so many things you have to deal with like insurance, liability, cleanliness etc. We can't just expect the world to change in an instant and naively believe everyone in the world does good.","1341887600","2012-07-10T02:33:20Z"

<i>""""Last night, I had to go to a dinner, and the cab that brought me back charged me twice as much as the cab that took me there,"" he said as he waited for another taxi outside his downtown hotel. Well, maybe not quite twice as much, he amended, but $12 vs. $19.50.""</i><p>And on meters:
<i>""But opponents of the meter say it would bring unwanted changes to D.C. taxi service: Residents traveling from poorer outlying neighborhoods in Southeast or Northeast probably could not afford a meter ride, they say, because it could add up to much more than a zone fare. Another reason fares could rise is that the meter would not stop clicking when the cab is idling in one of the city's infamous traffic jams.""</i> and <i>""If they get the meters, the only cab you'll see in this town will be at hotels, like the other major cities,"" Wright said. ""You won't find them anyplace else. You won't find them in the neighborhoods.""</i><p>The regulation on fares forces taxicabs to pass up many people who want to go outside areas with heavy foot traffic or deep pockets because they aren't going to be able to find a return fare. As such, there are ""taxi deserts"" all over the city where you might see one taxi every 45 minutes, and they've already got a fare, or their meter is off. Slugging through a 1.5-hour bus ride is often the most reliable form of transportation for these areas.<p>In order to maximize their payout, plenty of DC taxis will take zig-zagging routes, go slower than the speed limit, and ride their brakes. A 5.6-mile ride from the Atlas District up to Petworth may cost the same as an 8.5-mile ride from Columbia Heights up to Bethesda, using the meter system. Take a cab from outside the district and you'll find your trip takes significantly less time.<p>There's probably still a market for an Uber service, even with this brazen attack on (what seems to me as fair) competition. But don't expect the taxi lobby to roll over in a town where it took 75 years just to introduce meters.","1341929620","2012-07-10T14:13:40Z"

"4384602","anulman","anulman",,,"4382824","0","<i></i> TL;DR: Uber is innovative, but their approach (or lack thereof) to dealing with regulatory hurdles in each city disgusts me. <i></i><p>It seems like HN has already picked up on the major issues Uber faces in Boston, as well as pretty much every city: a new style of relationships with drivers, and ""metering"" virtually-on-demand livery rides, which are intended to be both unmetered and pre-arranged.<p>After seeing this same story repeated too many times now, and the resulting discussion, I feel the need to throw down. You don't need to trust me (IANAL, etc.), but based on my experience in the field -- I co-founded HireWinston (initially a Canadian, corporate-focused Uber competitor; we've since pivoted to competing indirectly by selling taxi fleets) -- I hope I have something to add.<p>First, the relationships with drivers: Uber tends to work directly with drivers (many, if not all, of whom they hire legally from existing livery services). In order to boost their chances of availability, they spend some of their hard-raised cash to book drivers for entire days, taking a steep loss at first in the hopes of driving enough demand to better satisfy their capacity.<p>In most cities, there are clear regulations that define a livery service. We found that, if you work as many commenters understand Uber working -- namely, as a network that has pre-arranged agreements with drivers or livery services to shuttle rides in their spare time -- you're in a sufficiently comfortable area not to get shut down. However, the way Uber works to juice supply (especially in newer markets) tends to clearly fall under the definition of a livery service, as they have their own ""employees"" that they pass rides to.<p>Second, the meters. This one I'm much more in their favour on: the phones themselves are not metering devices as the laws define them (i.e. they do not themselves calculate the price). I haven't personally torn into their source code, but having heard from an insider <i>and</i> having built this tech myself, I'm fairly confident their Driver App simply sends GPS data back to the server, where the calculation takes place according to a pre-defined rate. The customer either implicitly or explicitly accepts this rate through the TOS and/or by virtue of using the service (assuming the rates are published somewhere).<p>This setup guarantees they have something to show regulators if ever asked. From our research and testing, the integrity of the data from existing metering technology is similar enough to that from an iPhone or Android's GPS (ideally accompanied by accelerometer data). And, since the calculations happen on a server that records full route information rather than in a black box that discards it: way easier to share this with regulators. So A+.<p>Third, and most importantly, is what you don't see: Uber's relationships with city regulators. In Toronto, the municipal government sent us an official notice that they were concerned with our business, and that they wanted us to come talk through our business model and underlying technology with them. They were genuinely excited that there was innovation happening in the field in their city, and really just wanted to make sure we weren't doing anything egregiously wrong.<p>We sat down, and had an incredibly pleasant meeting. 30 minutes, back-and-forth Q&#38;A, with some regulators who have spent years in the space. They appreciated that we knew the laws, had worked to abide by them, and were comfortable with all but one aspect of our business model (cancellation fees). No C&#38;Ds were sent out.<p>At the end of the meeting, they asked us what we thought of Uber. Apparently, for months, the Uber team was dodging any request for a meeting the office sent them. While I definitely cannot attest to Uber Boston's actions on this front, I can't imagine that Uber Toronto was taking their plays from a different playbook.<p>In summary: Uber has done a tremendous job pushing the industry forward, and I'm confident that our approach -- selling the underlying software to existing taxi fleets, who truly want to better service their customers but have no idea what to do with technology -- is a more sustainable and dependable iteration on the model. I'm thankful to them, and I truly love a lot of the folks I know who work there.<p>That said, I have no sympathy whatsoever for these C&#38;Ds whenever I read about them. The company relies on deep pockets and public sympathy for the ""underdog technology company"" to change laws, rather than working with the existing system. And, frankly, normally I'd even be fine with that... if it weren't the taxi drivers -- the most marginalized members of the entire taxi ecosystem -- who were getting the shortest end of the stick.<p><i></i> DISCLAIMER: I do not, and have never, worked for Uber. Most of my knowledge comes from a mix of an outsider's view and third-party testimony of the approach that Uber has taken in Toronto and NYC. I'm not sure if Uber Boston took a different approach than Uber Toronto or Uber NYC, so take all specifics with a grain of salt. <i></i><p>(edit: formatting errors)","1345005227","2012-08-15T04:33:47Z"

That's missing the point of dynamic pricing (or ""surge"" pricing).  The point is that you can almost always reliably get a ride, regardless of demand, but at times with the highest demand (like New Years Eve) you have to pay more for that.  In return, Uber is able to pay their drivers more, and are able to better fill those high demand times (otherwise you'd just sit around waiting for a car, but would never get one because they're all already filled).  It's the right move from a platform perspective.

Uber is &#60; 15 minutes on average<p>o Drivers in Taxi's can be somewhat ""eccentric"" on the peninsula (As in, some of them scare me, they are so crazy).  Uber Drivers are professional, rated.<p>o Vehicles in Taxi's are pretty craptastic sometimes.  I've had to have the driver open my door (god forbid we get in an accident) - ubers vehicles professional Sedans.<p>o Airport Drivers will sometimes try and scam you for a 50% surcharge when they are still ""in zone"".  They even try and pull that on someone like me who flys in and out of SFO on a monthly basis - I can imagine how many just accept it.  Uber charges are identified <i>before</i> you book your trip.<p>o Lots of taxis will not take credit cards, or (try to) charge you a 10% surcharge - some of them would even RETURN to SFO when they discover you don't have cash.  Uber is 100% electronic.  No cash/credit card required, just your Smart Phone.<p>I love the electronic receipts, rating on the driver, certainty about when the vehicle is arriving.<p>On the peninsula, you pay about a 50% premium (or more, depending on demand), which is represented in the much higher quality trip you get.<p>I think if Uber was prepared to stick with that ""premium"" market, then the commissions wouldn't have a problem with them.  Their concern is that, much like AirBNB was a trojan horse to get into the Renting Apartments/compete with hotels market, Uber is going to start competing with regular taxis - and for someone who has paid &#62; $1mm for a medallion (<a href=""http://blogs.reuters.com/felix-salmon/2011/10/21/why-taxi-medallions-cost-1-million/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blogs.reuters.com/felix-salmon/2011/10/21/why-taxi-me...</a>) they are going to demand some sort of recompense and/or action be taken.<p>My guess is that there will be a strong correlation between cost of medallions and the resistance to Uber in any particular market.<p>What I would love to see, is that TAXI services adopt the uber model of source blind/closest taxi gets the trip/rate your driver/GPS location of Taxi/electronic receipts.  It would be good for the industry, good for the customers, and good for the reputable drivers/services.<p>The only ones who would lose out would be the crappy services, with poorly maintained vehicles, and lousy drivers .","1348352804","2012-09-22T22:26:44Z"

It's also notoriously difficult to find a good maid without playing the traditional ""networking"" game -- referrals, Craigslist, etc.<p>Personally, however, I see this only as a fill-in-the-gaps kind of service (which may be exactly what they're looking to provide). I have a regular maid who's been working at my place for 6+ years, charges a very reasonable rate ($25/hr), and most importantly, knows the apartment inside and out - exactly where to clean, how I like it, how to do the laundry, etc.<p>The biggest issue I see is the risk of extra-market activity. Whereas with Uber, car service is a true commodity, if Get Maid sends over a really terrific maid, there's a good chance that the buyer and maid are going to make a private arrangement for future work and cut Get Maid out of the deal.

These companies lease out the cars for a daily fee, like 150 bucks per day. The driver can do whatever he wants as long as he pays that daily fee. The cab company pays insurance because they own the cabs. Cab drivers are essentially independent contractors. They start making money after they've covered the cab cost for the day.<p>So why should the cab companies care if a driver is using über? From what I've heard, when a dispatcher has a good order, like for a trip across town on a slow day, they'll ask for a cut. In other words the cab companies are supplementing their taxi rental service with a cut of the fares they dispatch. And as a cab driver, if you want to get good orders you have to stay on the dispatchers good side.<p>Über changes the balance of power. As more people use über, the drivers have to rely on the dispatchers less, and the tit-for-tat system is deflated. I think this class action suit is an attempt to retain the status quo by cab companies. Über shouldn't be responsible for insurance until they start owning their own cabs.

That doesn't mean there aren't legitimate interests represented by those regulators, and those legitimate interests will be the rhetorical focus of the incumbent protection campaign.  Uber would do well to appreciate those legitimate interests and get well and truly on the right side of those questions.  Uber would also do well to understand the unstated agendas, legimate and otherwise, and strategize for meeting those.<p>Legitimate questions?  IANA taxi expert but I would guess:
- Value of incumbent licenses.  In NY cab drivers and companies spend hundred of thousands for medallions.  There are whole financing structures built around those values.  Protection of those values is probably a key objective of the regulators.<p>That really is a legitimate problem.  For one thing those values support an industry that provides jobs to working class people.  For another the city probably views those values as a signal of the stability of its policy environment.<p>- Stability.  Policy makers may well believe that the taxi system works on a number of dimensions, that systems like Uber may not work as well on all those dimensions, and that they may disrupt the system with unknown consequences.<p>- ""Universal service"".  One of those dimensions may be service availability to low income neighborhoods.  Cabs are supposed to take fares anywhere.  Regulators may fear that poor people may not have iPhones to play in Uber, and that drivers would discriminate against some neighborhoods if the poor people did.  It would not surprise me that the tacit model behind the cabs is ""you take the high fare business traffic to the airports, but also the lower revenue low income traffic.""  The high revenue types effectively subsidize the low revenue types.  This model happens EVERYWHERE in the regulated universe.<p>I wouldn't be surprised if the regulators were also simply trying to maintain their nests by maintaining control, and maybe some actual hard corruption.<p>But these folks are very, very capable at city politics.

The California-based company, which has stepped up its auditing efforts in the past year under chief executive Tim Cook, said it had uncovered 106 “active cases” of children being employed by its suppliers over the course of 2012, and 70 people who had been underage and either left or passed the age of 16 by the time of its audit.  None of those individuals is still employed by the suppliers, after Apple worked with its partners to help them spot fake identification documents or falsified records.  In one extreme case, 74 of those 106 under-16s were employed by a single Chinese manufacturer of circuit-board components used in Apple products. A large local labour agency “knowingly” supplied the children, Apple said.  Apple terminated its relationship with the supplier and reported the labour agency to the local authorities, who fined it and suspended its licence.  “Our approach to underage labour is clear: We don’t tolerate it, and we’re working to eradicate it from our industry,” Apple wrote in its report.  “When we discover suppliers with underage workers or find out about historical cases … we demand immediate corrective action.”  As Apple extends its audits deeper into its supply chain, prevention of underage labour and juvenile worker protection were the only two categories among its eight human rights auditing criteria where violations had increased since the previous year. Apple found improvements among its suppliers during 2012 in areas such as anti-discrimination, freedom of association and wages.  The Cupertino-based company is one of the few consumer electronics groups to publish detailed audits into its supply chain.  Overall it found that just under a quarter of its suppliers failed to comply with its labour and human rights standards, with other breaches including 11 facilities using bonded labour.<p>We don’t allow suppliers to act unethically or in ways that threaten the rights of workers – even when local laws and customs permit such practices - Apple As it tries to reduce excessive working hours, Apple said that 92 per cent of weeks worked by 1m employees tracked across its supply chain met its weekly criteria of a maximum of 60 work hours and at least one day off. That figure marks an improvement from 38 per cent a year ago, while Apple said that it had changed some of the ways it measured working hours to be “more meaningful and effective”.  Overtime increased among Apple’s suppliers during September, October and November, when Apple was ramping up production of its new iPhone 5 and iPad mini, but decreased again in December.  “We don’t allow suppliers to act unethically or in ways that threaten the rights of workers – even when local laws and customs permit such practices,” Apple said. “We’re working to end excessive work hours, prohibit unethical hiring policies, and prevent the hiring of underage workers.”","1359211035","2013-01-26T14:37:15Z"

For PR reasons, Uber understandably does not want to point out that bad event, but it would be pretty compelling if they said something like, ""Drivers, even if it was just one driver who ruined it for all of you, your bad behavior has forced our hand.

Lyft and Sidecar have nothing available or have ungodly wait times (6-15 minutes while standing in a busy part of the city), while an Uber can pick me up in under 2-3 minutes every time. Additionally, a lot of Lyft/Sidecar drivers will just pass on rides that are too far away and wait until someone closer makes a request. They can do this because the demand is significantly greater than supply, so it has little impact on them. This is very obvious by just watching the display while you're trying to flag down a ride (note: true even with 5* rating).<p>This makes me wonder if they should even be included as they're incredibly unreliable.

When they hear that the company is being sued by the taxi industry, they take note.  It's personal.  Taxi service has been bad for years, and everyone's been a victim of the absurd regulations which have lead to this sorry state.  Elected officials have been accustomed to taking advantage of regulated industries through corrupt actions (anything related to building or zoning permits as an example) without significant blow-back via news coverage or loss of reputation.  This time, it's different.  Look at how Washington DC's attempt to draft anti-Uber legislation lead to a national response via phone calls and emails. The proposed legislation was dropped.  I suspect Uber will eventually prevail in most of its markets, but the politicians will take awhile to realize that the public is taking interest in seemingly esoteric taxi regulations -- the sorts of laws which have been used for years to transfer money from the pockets of the electorate into the hands of those close to power.  I feel like I'm supporting democracy and freedom when I hit the ""request taxi"" button in the morning -- it's an action more powerful than my vote.","1365083355","2013-04-04T13:49:15Z"

I gave them another try a month back and now find myself using the service no fewer than 5 times a week. It literally eliminates every thing I hate about calling a cab. I love it now and almost rely on it at times.<p>I make sure to ask every single new driver about their experience with Uber and I have heard positive things across the board, save for a few minor complaints (usually about how the cut drivers get aren't <i>that</i> much higher than what they'd get at a traditional cab company). Most say they love it, many say they make extra cash using it on their off-times, and some say they have entire fleets running on Uber. Overall, from my experience, the drivers love and rely on it too.<p>I think the secret to their success is that they've simplified and streamlined the process elegantly for both drivers and passengers. A few taps and I'm on my way without worry of if I'll even get a cab (although, to be fair, it is at times difficult to find Uber cabs in Brooklyn), and whether I brought cash/credit. But what's really interesting is how they've seemed to simplify the process just enough for drivers. They tell me that <i>everything</i> is provided for them, down to the dashboard mount for the included iPhone. The software itself is simple enough to work and isn't wrought with rules and requirements, and that let's drivers find their own way to make the most out of the software in ways I'm sure the creators didn't expect. For example, one driver actually ended my trip early while I was still in the car, meaning I got charged less, because he didn't want to miss any potential pickups waiting for him at my destination, which I thought was a clever trick.<p>My point is that Uber is providing a service that both drivers and passengers seem to universally love. No one, as to my knowledge, is getting screwed for the benefit of another. That's why all these lawsuits seem like desperate attempts to take down a company whose service they know is better on all fronts.","1365087165","2013-04-04T14:52:45Z"

Without proper access to YouTube, Bing and other search engines cannot stand with Google on an equal footing in returning search results with links to YouTube videos and that, of course, drives more users away from competitors and to Google.<p>Second, in 2010 and again more recently, Google blocked Microsoft’s new Windows Phones from operating properly with YouTube. Google has enabled its own Android phones to access YouTube so that users can search for video categories, find favorites, see ratings, and so forth in the rich user interfaces offered by those phones.  It’s done the same thing for the iPhones offered by Apple, which doesn’t offer a competing search service.<p>Unfortunately, Google has refused to allow Microsoft’s new Windows Phones to access this YouTube metadata in the same way that Android phones and iPhones do.  As a result, Microsoft’s YouTube “app” on Windows Phones is basically just a browser displaying YouTube’s mobile Web site, without the rich functionality offered on competing phones.  Microsoft is ready to release a high quality YouTube app for Windows Phone.

"5834512","danpalmer","danpalmer",,,"5833716","2","Features: I'm all for simplicity, in the right circumstances. I use Clear from Realmac Software because when I'm creating to-do lists, speed is the most important thing to me. However, when I'm writing notes, accessibility is probably the most important thing for me and that means sync, I'd also bet this is the case for many people, hence the popularity of things like Evernote and Google Keep. The absence of sync from Vesper seems like a massive oversight, and makes me wonder if it's on the cards for a future version, or perhaps for a working iCloud? In addition to sync, I would have thought it would have Markdown support, even if it was transparent to the user in some way and<p>Price: The price doesn't hugely concern me here. If I find an app truly useful, then $5 is a small price to pay, and I support developers making a bit of a stand on this and charging premium prices for premium products. The feature set isn't one that interests me because of the lack of sync, so whether it was $5 or $1 wouldn't really make a difference for me.<p>Design: 'flat design' is nice when done well, but detracts from usability when done badly in my opinion. If you have a non-flat design, unless it's hugely over-the-top, I don't think it detracts from the usability. (sidenote, what's the correct terminology for the opposite of 'flat design'? It's certainly not skeumorphic) Lots of Microsoft's 'metro' styling does flat design well, using varying font sizes and typographic and visual hints to provide context to controls, whereas Visual Studio has gone too far and removed far to many visual cues which results in a less usable interface in my experience.<p>I feel that Vesper goes to far. As there is so little to the app it's hard to justify it being 'less usable', but I do think the interface to be a long way from correctly executed flat design. I think other apps and designs are far closer to how flat design should be.<p>Another interesting thing to note is the animation on transitioning to a new note. Federico Vittici made a GIF of it (<a href=""http://bit.ly/15EEKkP"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bit.ly/15EEKkP</a>) for his review (<a href=""http://bit.ly/11Hkz16"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bit.ly/11Hkz16</a>). Federico points out that it makes the interface feel a lot faster to the user, but I don't think it's the right thing to do. Firstly, as I said above, I don't think speed should be a priority for things like this, after all, the amount of time for a 0.5s transition is minuscule to the amount of time spent composing the note. But also it breaks the well known metaphor of the UI stack in iOS. The back button still indicates that it will move to the screen on the left, however the screen hasn't really moved in the user's mind. It's not a crucial point, but it's one of those 'papercuts' (<a href=""http://askubuntu.com/questions/1006/what-is-a-paper-cut"" rel=""nofollow"">http://askubuntu.com/questions/1006/what-is-a-paper-cut</a>) that I would expect a team such as the one behind this app to have addressed.<p>I wrote more than I planned to, so I might turn this into a blog post.

Not in the hardware at either end, but in the ""space between""? Computing has moved there too.<p>Work used to happen on a device and then was transferred to other devices, either manually (floppies, email) or later automatically (sync, dropbox).  Thanks to the web, mobile devices and lots of data, that's changed: Google Apps led the way, but Evernote etc all let you do your work in the <i>space between</i> devices.<p>Nowadays, putting the device first over the data (or ignoring other devices entirely, like this app does) is like putting the phone first over the call: beautiful, elegant hardware, refined way to dial, custom typeface for the numbers ... but you can't call anyone with it.<p>Apple in particular makes this mistake repeatedly. Photostream is device-first, so you have to work out what the hell is where and work out what you want to download to which machine. iTunes Match is device-first, so you're forever downloading and deleting tracks to make space on a particular device. Me.com tries to keep the sync truth on one of your devices, so conflicts abound. Notifications appear on all devices and often have to be dismissed individually on each of them. They see the world through the device first.<p>I suppose it's obvious why it happens -- they're a hardware company, and they grew up in a pre-networked world -- but I think misunderstanding this is one key reason they're seen as ""bad at services"" in comparison to Google, which is instinctively and entirely in ""the space between devices"".<p>As for this app, why would I ever want to be trapped in a single place again?

People tend to forget how Gruber makes his money and how that affects his blog. It requires companies with products that can profit after spending over $8000 on one ad to an audience of less than a million. Apple is a very popular brand, but the people who seek out daily information about Apple are the rich. Some may dispute that, saying that Apple makes products comparable to similar products from other companies&#x2F;it is worth the money it saves in the long term. That is rich people thinking. Look around any major city and compare where you see the iPhone ads and where you see the Boost Mobile&#x2F;Cricket ads. That should give you some idea of the differences in audiences.<p>Android has a philosophy, but the reason there isn&#x27;t an Android Gruber is there isn&#x27;t room in Android news&#x2F;punditry for a writer exclusively for the rich. You aren&#x27;t part of a special group for owning an Android. They give away Androids with haircuts and don&#x27;t sell &#x27;em with fancy ads about how it was designed by pretty people in California. The app market for Android trends towards free with ads without the Instapaper&#x2F;Loren Brichter niche of paid apps. A guy like Gruber is useless in the Android world for multiple reasons. There is very little mystique about Android, so the Kremlinology Gruber provides is pointless. You don&#x27;t need an unaffiliated spokesperson when Google+ is essentially a public discussion forum for those working on Android. It is hard to get excited about an insider when anyone who cares can know nearly everything of interest. The philosophy of Android does have a whiff of open source about it so by nature means the culture will be diffused and fractured into separate camps that won&#x27;t appoint a figurehead like Gruber. Most importantly, Gruber&#x27;s audience is too small for the smurfberry&#x2F;ad funded apps and not large enough to justify dropping four figures for the low conversion Android would have on paid apps.","1374636659","2013-07-24T03:30:59Z"

OS changes to make their products more similar to their competition, or to benefit only new hardware. Less focus on the developer set. A new Mac Pro that is less upgeadable than previous versions. New macbooks with soldered in RAM and no expansion slots (want a RAM upgrade? Buy a new computer for 10x the cost, from us only!). I was so into Apple in 2007, when the statement was true. Now they&#x27;re just the new Microsoft. The thing is, there will likely be no Apple-like competitor that comes after them.

is now the implication, hint,
suggestion, claim, etc. that somehow
Google, Facebook, Apple, and Samsung
beat Microsoft at its own business.
I don&#x27;t buy that.<p>That hint, etc. plays well with 
consumers who see computing just in terms
of consumer client devices.<p>Here are two blunt facts:<p>First, many more client devices
need servers, and Microsoft with
Windows Server, SQL Server,
and many software tools for
system installation, monitoring,
and management has demonstrated that
it knows how to run one heck of a
big server farm with surprisingly
small staff.<p>Second, people still need to work,
at a computer &#x27;work station&#x27; complete
with a good, physical keyboard, the
old kind with keys that move,
and one or more screens, hopefully large,
and maybe more than one.  And they need
to run some major software applications
in graphics, high end word processing,
video creation, editing, and production,
engineering, statistics, etc., and for
that people still need a high end
desktop computer with, from Microsoft,
Windows 7 that can run both 32 bit
and 64 bit software.  That work station
may have 32 GB of main memory
and 12 TB of disk memory.  So, no
smart phone or tablet can compete.<p>Yes, Apple sold a lot of iPhones,
and McDonald&#x27;s sold a lot of
hamburgers, but that doesn&#x27;t
really mean that Microsoft
should get in either the 
phone or hamburger business
or was beaten by either
Apple or McDonald&#x27;s.<p>For the new CEO of Microsoft
to push Microsoft into
mobile client devices in
competition with Apple 
and Samsung and software for
such devices in competition
with Apple and Google and to
ignore desktops and servers
would be huge mistake.<p>Yes, generally if there is a new
business opportunity that involves
software, Microsoft should consider
getting in, e.g., search and Bing.
And maybe Microsoft should push
mobile client devices and associated
operating system and application
software, etc., but to ignore
desktops and servers would be
dumb, dumber than anything

It&#x27;s a heck of a lot cheaper than DUIs, wrongful death lawsuits and suspensions and fines by the NFL.<p>Services like Uber go beyond calling a cab company because they are easy to use in a way that digitally-savvy people understand (and most NFL players are pretty good with smartphones) and the cars are nicer than cabs. In certain cities, it&#x27;s easy to get a cab. You pretty much just need to stand on the corner of a street for a few minutes. In other cities, it can be a nightmare.<p>In those markets where getting a cab can be a huge problem, this will help a lot. And this will also help in markets where cab drivers refuse to leave the city.

"6603157","DigitalSea","DigitalSea",,,"6603008","2","I will have to side with Microsoft here, everything said is in-fact true. The Surface from a technical perspective trumps the iPad, it&#x27;s effectively a true computer (USB ports, storage options) inside of a tablet form. In all honesty, it was never Apple that was focused, it was Steve Jobs. When Jobs was at the helm, he did things differently to everyone else and it was this different approach that got Apple to where it is now. The legacy that Steve Jobs created is being carried on, albeit rather loosely. It&#x27;s obvious Apple are losing their way very slowly, we can&#x27;t forget that the iPad and iPhone were both masterminded by Jobs and Johnny. I mean seriously, the iPad Air? It has nothing to gloat about except being lighter, but was the iPad ever that heavy to warrant being lighter? It already weighed less than some books can way.<p>Microsoft don&#x27;t get enough credit, they&#x27;ve done a lot of things wrong, but I think the Surface is a solid device that doesn&#x27;t get enough attention. The price point was definitely wrong, if you want to rival Apple you have to undercut them in the market. Most people don&#x27;t buy Apple devices because of technical specs, they buy them because of the large library of applications, the hype around owning an Apple device and the look and feel. When is the last time you heard someone saying they were going to buy an iPad because of the kind of CPU it has?<p>The iPad and Surface Pro 2 are both fantastic devices that can achieve the same things. The software is different, but on a hardware level they are both highly capable devices with seemingly limitless potential. Apple has the better OS for the moment and the better design, but Microsoft has the better hardware. For those that have used both iWork and Microsoft Office, it&#x27;s obvious that Microsoft wins hands down. You never see anything other than Microsoft office being used in the enterprise and I doubt you ever will in this lifetime.<p>If you want to win accolades and praise, making fun of the competition in this way makes you look like a jealous douche, both Apple and Microsoft come across as childish to me. Once upon a time Apple in terms of their public presence and marketing never really mentioned the competition but based on remarks that Tim Cook made, it&#x27;s obvious their strategy is to no longer take the high ground and let the consumer make their choice, they&#x27;re playing hard-ball with Microsoft and Samsung now.","1382583286","2013-10-24T02:54:46Z"

What I mean is that as you have gotten used to Uber, your expectations of basic fundamental service have risen.<p>Yeah ... no. I got fed up with taxi service in SF about 2 years ago and started using Uber. At first I was astounded: very clean cars, very nice drivers who were accommodating and pleasant (all I want is a quiet ride without the radio blaring or the driver shouting into his phone the whole way). Best of all, the drivers were knowledgable about the city and didn&#x27;t need me to tell them turn-by-turn how to do something basic like get across town. It was what I always wanted, and totally worth the extra cost vs. a regular taxi.<p>It&#x27;s hard to put my finger on exactly when it started, but in the last few months the &quot;black car&quot; service has degraded to the point where it feels like the old taxi days. Usually the car is dirty, smells bad, the driver has the radio blasting loud (and doesn&#x27;t exactly react all that well if I ask to turn it down or off), and the driver&#x27;s attitude is frequently incredibly grouchy (I&#x27;ve had to listen to them complain about their jobs quite a bit lately), and worst of all, they don&#x27;t know their way around the city at all.<p>Just to make sure I wasn&#x27;t experiencing what Mr. Kalanick is suggesting in terms my expectations being calibrated differently, I have made it a point to take regular taxis a few times lately. Instead of a categorically different experience (which is how I would have described the difference between Uber and a taxi in the past), the only differences now between the taxi and the Uber &quot;black car&quot; service seem to be the price and the color of the outside of the car. Oh, and in some cases the regular taxi drivers actually know the city better than the Uber drivers.<p>I don&#x27;t really blame Uber for all this, as I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s really hard to maintain that level of quality while growing at double-digit rates. But I do think they need to take a good hard look at the &quot;black car&quot; service and make sure the drivers know what kind of experience they are supposed to provide. It really should not feel like a taxi with a different coat of paint on the outside.","1383075580","2013-10-29T19:39:40Z"

Anecdotal evidence here but probably relevant- I got a mail from Uber a while back, where (presumably) some automation noticed that I was taking a bunch of uber rides to the airport when I was in Boston, but never from, so it offered some Uber credit to use from the airport. I was pretty stoked that Uber had such great analytics and this past Saturday, requested an uber when I landed. Once I got picked up however, it was a different story, with the driver claiming I had &quot;tricked him&quot; and that it was illegal for him to pick anyone up from the airport and that Uber had specifically given him guidance not to pick anyone up from the airport. Clearly there was some miscommunication there and although he calmed down once I explained my side of the story, it still creates a bad experience (probably for both the customer and the driver). Uber support was reasonably prompt in getting back to me but it was somewhat of a non-reply and I still don&#x27;t know if picking people up at Logan Airport is a supported scenario or not. However, my positive experiences with Uber far outweigh the negative ones and I think Uber still has that built-up goodwill going for it which should cushion it through these growing pains.","1383082774","2013-10-29T21:39:34Z"

Fourth, the quality in SF has been declining for those of us with a longitudinal view over time, and even if the top-line metric of overall reviews inflates the NPS score, the fact that this is striking a chord with &quot;power users&quot; should be alarming.

I&#x27;ve used and seen it used over and over, normally following something like this:<p>1. There&#x27;s a problem.  Generally it&#x27;s a pretty big deviation from normal service involving a non-trivial loss, like paying an order of magnitude more for a cab than is necessary.<p>2. The customer tries to notify the company, normally just to recover the loss.<p>3. If it&#x27;s a start up, there probably is limited or isn&#x27;t any customer service.  Larger companies will generally put people through a large, automated, slow, and probably ineffective process with tickets and machine answering systems.  The issue isn&#x27;t resolved either way.<p>4. Next up is a tweet.  Some complaint about the issue @somecompany. A lot of companies large and small have embraced Twitter as a psuedo-support channel.<p>5.

However, it looks like there was a bug here that duplicated the adjustment (creating an additional $83 charge), which resulted in the $166 adjustment. Our engineers have already started looking into this to see exactly what went wrong.<p>I understand this is a big inconvenience and you shouldn&#x27;t have to pay for this hassle, so I have refunded this trip in full (card receipt attached) -- you should see the refund back on your card in the next few business days. Additionally, for the delay in our response, I have added a $50 credit to your account. It looks like you ride in San Francisco most often, so this should get you a few rides on us.

The mining is simply irrelevant. There will be 22M coins, give or take, and the joules to find the hashes simply do not matter. And when the coins are all found, the miners will continue to simply clear transactions, which any network needs, and furthermore still doesn&#x27;t create any meaningful cost.<p>Bitcoin has problems, but the mining is beside the point. and his follow on argument is... bitcoin is valuable now because nerds conflate economics with technology, and will soon pop?

"7132470","bronbron","bronbron",,,"7132047","0","It&#x27;s interesting watching this, because it seems inevitable that Uber will become exactly like the service it was meant to compete with: the Taxi industry.<p>The whole saga has good, bad, and meh elements to all of it.<p>It&#x27;s good that the question of auto insurance is coming up. I imagine that many of these drivers are painfully unaware that they are in serious insurance limbo. If someone&#x27;s a de facto Uber employee, then yeah, Uber should pay for damages that the driver causes. It&#x27;s definitely an exaggeration to say that Uber will &quot;leave a trail of bodies in the street&quot;, but it&#x27;s also unfair that the victim gets screwed here (because there&#x27;s no chance in hell the driver&#x27;s personal insurance will cover this).<p>It sucks that the odds are so stacked against them for providing (what at least used to be, I rarely use them nowadays) a good service. I remember being in SF a couple years back and trying to hail a cab for 30 minutes before getting an Uber in ~5 minutes. It was really shitty, and Uber really came through in the end. I was glad to pay the price difference.<p>Regardless of what happens, there&#x27;s a lot of interesting ideas here that hopefully get noticed. Surge pricing&#x27;s an interesting idea. Whereas taxis sacrifice reliability for relatively stable pricing, I&#x27;m glad there&#x27;s a competing service that sacrifices stable pricing for reliability. It lets you make the decision about which is more important, and I&#x27;m sure we&#x27;ve all been in situations where getting somewhere quickly was worth the extra money.","1390850440","2014-01-27T19:20:40Z"

Uber and Airbnb seem to be simple and elegant businesses that in part increase supply by freeing up unused resources while competing on price and service with established industries such as taxis and hotels. Now that they have made some headway people are specifically buying apartments and cars to participate.<p>This issue seems like Airbnb&#x27;s in NYC where room&#x2F;apartment renters are being required to play by the same rules as the  hotel folks with respect to insurance and safety.<p>One thing that recently impressed me and that I would like to see happen more generally is the Attorney General&#x27;s response to the challenge of banking with respect to marijuana businesses in Colorado and Washington. Banks were turning away pot shops that are legal at the state level but illegal at the Federal level. Within a few weeks of the advent of legal marijuana sales the AG&#x27;s office has stepped in to say that they want to find a solution to enable marijuana merchants and banks to do business. I am impressed by the responsiveness of &quot;the law&quot; in this case.

We hired a babysitter through care.com but on the days when she is not available, we have to find a backup. If you didn&#x27;t plan the backup in advance, you are screwed. For example, our babysitter suddenly could not come for 2 days as her hubby got food poisoning and needed her to stay home with him.<p>So in theory, an &quot;Uber for babysitting&quot; sounds like a good idea where the &quot;on-demand&quot; part is the key. However, the biggest issue I see with something like this is the &quot;trust factor&quot;. Babysitters are a very personal thing because they are responsible for the <i>most</i> important thing in your life i.e. your kid. So, when we hire a babysitter traditionally, we do our due diligence, check references etc. and then build trust over time during their first few weeks&#x2F;months of work. Example, our current babysitter is now with us for about 3 months and we are just about beginning to trust her. We still don&#x27;t leave her completely alone with our baby (wife staying home for now) but soon, we have to do that. For on-demand, how will this work ? Can I trust someone &quot;uber&quot; like ?

In fact, I&#x27;ve had my own problems with them as well to justify that bold of a statement.<p>Back in the fall of 2013 a cab driver charged me $30 in Chicago instead of what the meter said (which was around $8). After this happened, I had contacted Uber support and they merely gave me some automated style response saying there was nothing they could do because the city sets the cab pricing. First off, they treated me like I was an idiot with a response like that. Of course I knew the city set the rates, that wasn&#x27;t the issue I was contacting them about. Secondly, they completely ignored my problem all together. I wasn&#x27;t complaining because the price per mile was higher than UberX or something like that. If I had, what they sent would have been a perfect response. But no, I was complaining because the cab driver down right stole money from me, and there was nothing I could do about it. They could clearly see in the receipt that the time traveled, distance, etc. could have no way in hell been worth $30 that I was charged. In fact, it was a cab ride to work so I had plenty of other receipts that showed it was typically around $8-10. So, like OP, my support ticket was marked &quot;solve&quot; and I was duped $20, and never contacted again (even after I replied trying to further explain my problem). It was after this that Uber always left a bad taste in my mouth. It was a straight slap in the face to me (the customer) by Uber.","1398229802","2014-04-23T05:10:02Z"

Overpriced, perhaps, but there&#x27;s not much competition to stop that.<p>Reading the audiophile boards, the trends seems to be that the Beats Studio is now roughly competitive to the venerable Audio Technica ATH M50 , widely considered to be one of the most popular entry-level audiophile quality over-ear headphones.   The main difference is not audio quality (the M50 probably has an edge here) but rather comfort and ear fatigue, with the Beats just being more comfortable.<p>I love my M50s but admit they do lead to sweaty-ear.<p>Examples:<p><a href=""http://www.head-fi.org/t/683959/new-beats-studios-2013-vs-audio-technica-ath-m50"" rel=""nofollow"">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.head-fi.org&#x2F;t&#x2F;683959&#x2F;new-beats-studios-2013-vs-au...</a>

It&#x27;s that the market will bear that much of a price difference when the ATH M50 is $150.   But, people will pay a lot for a wide selection of colours and a bit more comfort.  And price can be seen as a feature.<p>In short - Beats sells decent quality for its class,  overpriced for what you get, but between comfort and colour selection, customers don&#x27;t seem to mind.

Part of Uber&#x27;s challenge in Europe is the variety of regulations governing the continent, even among the 28-member European Union, each of which has different unions and different rules.</i><p>It&#x27;s easy to dismiss off the protestors as old hat for not reacting gracefully to a changing market, but the issue at least in London seems to largely be with the fact that their existing businesses are subject to more costs and regulations than the kinds that Uber and other services are facing.<p>So let&#x27;s spare a thought for the taxi drivers who&#x27;ve spent years building up their skills and knowledge of the local area, especially in places like London [1], and hope that they can be given the opportunity to compete with Uber. After all, if it weren&#x27;t for the existing Taxi industry it&#x27;s possible companies like Uber wouldn&#x27;t even exist.<p>There should be space in the market for both the traditional offering and the fancy new one, and I hope that they can learn from each other and improve as a result of the competition, rather than die out.<p>EDIT: To be clear, I&#x27;m not saying Uber should be forced to play by the rules.

I spent 10 days there recently and I clocked almost 4 hours a day on the road to various places.  In all fairness I had to commute in from up north (think Santa Rosa) for family reasons but I still had flash backs to my life in Los Angeles and the absolute necessity of having a car.<p>I’m doubtful that if I do move that I can find a commute to work as sweet as my current job.  I walk (by choice) about 9 blocks and subway 9 more and can make the entire trip in 22 minutes anytime of day I like regardless of other commuters.   In SF you have to consider traffic, bus overloading, being in just the right place at the right time to optimize your commute, or just buy a car or just use Uber and get there when you want on your schedule (still fighting traffic but that&#x27;s the driver&#x27;s problem).<p>Having grown up in Los Angeles I used to think SF public transportation was pretty advanced, but having lived in New York and the area here I realize trains, subways and the like are just much more effective here.  My uninformed guess is because trains where ingrained in the local culture investments in subway, commuter trains and the like where easier to justify.  In California the car was able to take hold early because of the sprawling nature of population distribution and since then it’s been near impossible to convince tax payers to build public transportation in face of all the other priorities for public tax dollars.<p>I think the “advent” of the electric car has made people feel they’re “doing the right thing” meanwhile it will not solve traffic issues and will only stall investment in public transportation by another fifty years.<p>I acknowledge the fact that many factors feed into transportation choices (Children, Luggage, Time, Schedules, Costs) but I also think underlying issues in a locality have a greater impact then individual choices.  Walt Disney and Ray Bradbury both tried to fight the “good fight” for years in Los Angeles proposing Monorail systems and you can see where they managed to get.<p>To condemn individuals who use Uber and Lyft is like treating the symptom rather then curing the disease.  Until we have real plans to make better transportation options available to the public they will continue to solve their daily problems using their own resources however they feel meets their needs.

So their return profile looks like:  if Uber is worth anything more than a couple billion dollars (which they may view as near-certain), they get their money back + interest.  Then they hold an option should Uber execute like Amazon, as others have suggested, and dramatically exceed their near-term market potential.<p>Valuing this is quite tricky:  presumably the people who invested $250M less than a year ago thought:  I only have to clear ~$400M to get my bait back, now that number is 3-4x higher.<p>While it is highly likely that the new investors have some sort of preferred return, it&#x27;s possible (though less likely) that have a participating preferred or some other more complex instrument.

"7916321","adamodar","adamodar",,,"7911560","5","I am flattered that so many of you read my piece and felt the urge to respond. To begin with, I hope I did not come through as claiming a monopoly on the truth (and fair value). I tried to make my best assessment of what I think Uber&#x27;s value is today, given what I know about the company.<p>It is true that I valued it as a car service company but that is the only business where it has a business model that works right now. As many of you argue, there are potential markets here (moving, car rentals and even car ownership) that Uber could enter. If that is the argument for the extra $12 billion, the pieces are in place to estimate whether you can justify that addition. These additional markets (especially car ownership) could make the potential market much larger, but the question then becomes whether Uber&#x27;s business model can be expanded into these businesses, while preserving the its profitability. Take, for instance, the driverless electric car market which is the alluring possibility. Even if you are an optimist on this development, I am still grappling with the role that Uber will play in this market and the profitability that will ensue. Will Uber continue to play the middleman role, and if so, who will it be negotiating with? If the electric cars are owned by Google or some other large entity, will Uber have the bargaining power to demand a large slice?<p>In closing, here are three beliefs that I bring to the table. First, I am a believer that DCF is a tool that can be expanded to cover almost any narrative you may have. Second, I have no illusions about being right, when there is this much uncertainty about the future, but I would rather be transparently wrong (where you can see the assumptions that i have made and change them to reflect your narrative) than to be opaquely right. (I think that providing absurdly large valuation ranges as your base valuation is a cop out, as is making fluffy statements like &quot;I think Uber has lots of potential and is worth a lot&quot;) Finally, I think that there is a big difference between pricing (where the number you attach to an asset is what people are willing to pay for it right now) and value. I have a great deal of respect for the pricing process (which is what delivered the $17 billion for Uber) but I also think that pricing is driven by mood and momentum, both of which can get ahead of the facts.","1403189111","2014-06-19T14:45:11Z"

But the surge price to the single mother who desperately needs the cab to get to school to pick up her kids on time before the school closes and they have to walk home in the rain with out jackets is breaking the bank.<p>This does not make things &quot;better for everyone&quot; as the article argues.

It&#x27;s useful only if you plan in advance, if you haven&#x27;t reserved a car for the weekend by Wednesday forget about it.<p>The 2) service though you just swipe your metro card on the panel for an auto-mobile car parked somewhere, drive for $0,30&#x2F;minute and leave the car anywhere (in some very big zones in the cities).

I drive 5k miles a year and determined that it would be more expensive to shift to either UberX or Zipcar.  Let&#x27;s see what is up with the math:<p>&gt; Costs of ownership<p>The largest error is here, where the author uses a constant number regardless of miles driven -- and then compares it to variable w&#x2F; miles UberX costs!.  But maintenance, insurance, depreciation, and fuel costs are all costs that increase with miles driven.<p>Secondly, all these costs are taken from AAA numbers that are looking at 5 year depreciation of a new car.  If you drive an older vehicle, your costs are nowhere near this high. (if they are to be believed, my cars&#x27; annual depreciation would be 80% of the value of my car!)<p>&gt; Parking costs at $1300&#x2F;year<p>First off, the claim on ABC is &quot;average American family&quot;, not &quot;average American&quot; (<a href=""http://abcnews.go.com/WNT/video/average-american-spends-1300-year-parking-21216093"" rel=""nofollow"">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;abcnews.go.com&#x2F;WNT&#x2F;video&#x2F;average-american-spends-1300...</a>), so this is likely off by a factor of nearly 2.
Secondly, this is massively skewed by location. In dense locations (say SF), this can shoot into $2000+ a year, but in lower density places (say San Jose area), this may be well under $200.
Finally, workplace parking can be paid by pre-tax dollars which lowers this cost by another 30% or so.<p>&gt; Opportunity costs<p>Where is the assumption that car driving is at 0% productivity and UberX riding is at 50% productivity coming from?  (I definitely don&#x27;t believe this empirically)  Also note this is ignoring any opportunity cost of having to wait for an UberX to arrive.  The real opportunity cost difference may be insignificant.<p>My own conclusion:
A single article won&#x27;t allow anyone to make a determiniation. UberX may win in some cases over owning a car, but it is highly dependent on individual behavior.","1409512374","2014-08-31T19:12:54Z"

Especially with newer carpool features like UberPool and Lyft Line.<p>LA is currently investing a lot into building more light rail infrastructure.  However, regardless of how much LA invests in rail, for most commuters the rail will only get them most of the way to their workplace.  Before UberX and Lyft, the only options for the last leg of the trip were bicycle (which has a lot of limits), bus (too unreliable), and taxi (too expensive).<p>UberX and Lyft provide an option that didn&#x27;t exist before.  And it&#x27;s cheap and reliable enough to a be a very good option.  As LA continues to build more rail, I think it has the potential to greatly change commuting in the future.  Maybe it will become common for young single people to not own a car and rely on Uber&#x2F;Lyft combined with rail.  And then when they get married and have kids, then buying one car makes sense.

In an insatiable world demanding instant news and updates, conventional wisdom suggests this should not work ...  but it does, spectacularly so.","1410273382","2014-09-09T14:36:22Z"

"8352620","jonnathanson","jonnathanson",,,"8352209","7","Apple still makes a lot of money selling tracks on the iTunes store. My guess would be that it&#x27;s going to roll out a streaming service, but on its own terms. This probably means renegotiating a lot of the music rights previously negotiated by Beats, and starting with a clean slate. Apple probably figures it can get better terms from the labels than Beats did.<p>Part of me thinks that the only reason a la carte purchasing still exists is because there is no way to get everything from one streaming service. To use a TV example: I can&#x27;t get most HBO shows on Netflix; ergo, I use Netflix and HBO Go. Same thing with Showtime, so I use Showtime&#x27;s app as well. And some things I can&#x27;t get anywhere through a streaming service, so I buy them. I&#x27;m not buying a la carte because I feel the need to &quot;own&quot; things. I&#x27;m buying a la carte because the fragmented streaming landscape has significant gaps in its coverage. What I&#x27;m really doing, when I buy, is covering those gaps <i>and&#x2F;or</i> hedging against the risk that something I love might go away on my streaming services.<p>My wild hunch is that Apple realizes as much, and it&#x27;s moving to get as much content as possible under new license before it reveals its streaming service. It knows that a streaming service, in 2014 or 2015, needs to be as selection-complete as humanly possible. And anything not on its streaming service needs to be for sale on iTunes.

Solved.<p>2. Manufacturing and marketing factors<p>- Distribute 5,000 beta devices and really field test them.  Manufacturers, especially Apple, hate to do this because it reveals the secret design in advance of the dramatic release event.  But field testing the devices makes more sense given their complexity and unknown uses and conditions to which they will be subjected.<p>- Make the devices thicker and sturdier.  Many of us would not complain about an extra millimeter or two of thickness, especially if it means a bigger battery and some nice-to-haves such as a memory card slot.  Thinness is costly, too.  Make it an indestructible brick, charge less, and millions will continue to buy the devices.<p>- An alternative view:  yield to bendiness!  Make the displays bendy, make the cases flexible, and accept that customers want to abuse their phones by sitting on them in tight jeans.","1411567910","2014-09-24T14:11:50Z"

Note I&#x27;m not calling for FTC action, but (again, if this is true) Uber&#x27;s management owes me and other users an explanation, an apology, and a plan for privacy controls to ensure this doesn&#x27;t happen again.

Any competitor who wants into the market is going to charge a fee. The fact that nobody has succeeded in this in the American market means the market needs something that works first before fees become the issue. Apple can always lower the fee if they feel pressure. Remember that nay-sayers said the App Store 30% cut would never work because it was too high, but anybody who remembers this market before the App Store remembers that 3rd party payment services were often just as expensive if not more because you often had to do the labor of tying multiple services together (web site, shopping cart, payment authentication). Additionally, Apple promised and delivered in being able to draw in and convert more potential customers into buyers.<p>2) Inferior tech: Technology isn&#x27;t the problem. The technology has been around in other countries. There is something different about the American market that has prevented adoption of this kind of transaction system. Apple&#x27;s belief is it is the seamless integration, not the technology.<p>3) Little incentive for adopters: Self-interest may prove to be enough incentive. You only need to think back to McDonald&#x27;s and other fast-food&#x27;s semi-recent fight to remove credit card signatures from small transactions. They fought hard for this because their own market research found that signatures discouraged credit card transactions and slowed down lines. Their other research showed that people spent more money on average than compared to when they paid with cash (because they didn&#x27;t have to worry about not having enough cash on hand). Merchants may have enough self-interest to adopt this system in order to speed up lines (more customers with fewer cashiers) and get higher spending per customer.","1412738639","2014-10-08T03:23:59Z"

When I went to add my other cards to Apple Pay yesterday, I was surprised to see that it wasn&#x27;t automatically added as my default Apple Pay card because it&#x27;s my main iTunes account card (which is supposed to be what happens).<p>Puzzled, I tried manually adding it. Nope, unsupported.<p>So then I activated my Capital One card, which went perfectly fine. Then tried my Simple.com debit card, which failed, but I know they&#x27;re working on compatibility. My Fidelity account card I never expected to work, but tried anyway.<p>So then, still curious about what was going on, I called Chase directly and spoke to someone about it.<p>She really did seem to be confused, initially, about why the Amazon card wasn&#x27;t supported. She acknowledged that some of their cards weren&#x27;t supported right now and was about to make that her official statement on the matter, but then after a minute or two she seemed to either look something up on their internal computer systems, pull out some paperwork about it, or silently gesture to someone in the vicinity (manager? who knows), and then told me that the Amazon card would be working with Apple Pay in the near future. What information she based that on, I can&#x27;t say, but that was the clear indication.<p>Given that Chase is obviously ok with customers using Apple Pay (they likely see it as being in their favor for us to use Apple Pay due to lower risk of fraud related to merchant leaks. Target. Home Depot. Enough said), I imagine they would like me to use this Chase Amazon card with Apple Pay too, particularly since I use it a lot everywhere.<p>I expect this issue is likely some boring detail that hadn&#x27;t been worked out by the time Apple Pay went live, rather than a political issue over Kindle books or hypothetical competition from a mobile Amazon Payment service tied to Fire phones.<p>And I doubt Amazon has all that much say in what Chase does with customer accounts that they consider &quot;theirs&quot; anyway. For all intents and purposes, this is a Chase credit account and a Chase card, not an Amazon card (Amazon Store cards exist, but this certainly isn&#x27;t one of them).<p>Chase is the one extending the credit line, Chase is the one who assessed my risk and ability to pay before setting the terms on the account, I can visit a local Chase branch to talk to them about it, I pay it off by visiting chase.com or using the official Chase mobile app, and were I to default, it would be Chase suing me. The only indication that Amazon is even involved is their logo on the front of what is otherwise VERY obviously a Chase branded card, and that the rewards for the card are applied as credit toward Amazon purchases.<p>We&#x27;ll see what happens, but a week from now, a month at the latest, I expect it&#x27;ll work. And if it doesn&#x27;t and Amazon really is screwing with this card&#x27;s Apple Pay compatibility, the only effect it&#x27;ll have is to make me favor other cards instead, and only use this one to pay for Netflix every month just to keep it in use.","1413932815","2014-10-21T23:06:55Z"

By some metrics, the global taxi industry is worth no more than $25B.[0] This seems spurious, and Nate Silver, using a different metric, values the taxi industry at about $100B.[1]<p>So it might seem as if Uber would have to seize a large fraction of the taxi market in order to justify its valuation. Some (myself included) say this is unrealistic, because Uber is unlikely to hold on to a monopoly or majority share of the rideshare market.[2]<p>The important factor, however, is that Uber is rapidly expanding what previously was the conceived size of this market. People who were not taking taxis previously are now using Ubers. There was an article on here recently about parents using Uber to ferry their children around. Some folks are leaving their cars at home, and are using Uber instead, because it makes sense financially (gas+car maintenance costs, in some cases, are higher than those of taking an Uber).<p>Beyond this, I expect to eventually see the integration of the rideshare market (Uber, Lyft, etc.) with other services, like delivery and last-mile transportation. This is already being done by Uber Rush. I would not be surprised to see Uber and its competitors greatly expand what we previously thought of as the Taxi industry, such that even a small share of this very large industry could be well worth the $25B valuation.<p>[0] <a href=""http://iterativepath.wordpress.com/2014/05/22/if-you-most-aggressively-value-uber-from-its-only-known-revenue-model/"" rel=""nofollow"">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;iterativepath.wordpress.com&#x2F;2014&#x2F;05&#x2F;22&#x2F;if-you-most-ag...</a><p>[1] <a href=""http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/uber-isnt-worth-17-billion/"" rel=""nofollow"">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;fivethirtyeight.com&#x2F;features&#x2F;uber-isnt-worth-17-billi...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://johnloeber.com/w/uber.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;johnloeber.com&#x2F;w&#x2F;uber.pdf</a> shameless plug","1415407102","2014-11-08T00:38:22Z"

I know of people who switched company or broker based on statements the owner of the one company made on radio about cyclists.  When Uber is new in town it is a &#x27;cool&#x27; thing to do, but once they are not so new people find reasons to change.  This makes for an interesting and dynamic market.

I&#x27;ve been using Lyft far more than Uber lately even though I view them as completely interchangeable services and I&#x27;m not known for having strong brand loyalty. In SF, Lyft and Uber are comparable on both price and speed, so it&#x27;s an easy decision to use one service over the other, even if you only have a slight preference.  For me the shift hasn&#x27;t happened out of outrage at Uber, but because I like the Lyft experience so much more.  Lyft drivers are overwhelmingly friendly and Lyft Line tends to attract similarly friendly people.  I&#x27;ve had some great conversations while sharing rides on Lyft Line where I actually didn&#x27;t want the ride to end so soon.  I&#x27;ve swapped contact info with some cute girls, met a potential hire, and landed a couple new customers all while sharing rides on Lyft.<p>I like that Lyft has a reputation for taking care of their drivers.  In the words of one driver I rode with, &quot;there are no drivers protesting outside the Lyft office&quot;.  Instead, their drivers speak highly of the company.  As a company, they seem like they are starting to find their stride.  Their mission from the beginning was to get people to shares rides and fill up all those single-passenger cars you see everywhere.  They&#x27;re making good progress on that mission today and cutting down on traffic is something I care about as well.  Uber has a ride-sharing option too, but they don&#x27;t seem to be nearly as motivated by that purpose.  I&#x27;m not sure what Uber&#x27;s mission is actually.","1416387986","2014-11-19T09:06:26Z"

I wrote Hundereds of letters to the so called Alternetive media outlets both on line as in print, ...no response, I&#x27;ve been made Homeless; after working for the same media in the Netherlands&#x2F;USA for over 15 years!
Been stalked massive, and arrested many time, even to the point were I cannot leave the country AMS schiphol Airport without being arrested on some bogus charges,wich I&#x27;m cleared of , but made me miss my flight!And as I&#x27;m in low financial times, It&#x27;s hard for me to just packup and leave, without having some sort of place to stay..
My question:
If you have any advice or links from trustworthy people in Europe that I can link with, to stay with for a while, to get my cables published!
I &#x27;m able to pay a little contribution for my stay, and food , or could do odd jobs ( I&#x27;m easy )
So that&#x27;s it !
It will blow your mind , this is real and not a hoax!If there was an other way for me to get some form of support I would try it, rather then having to bother people I&#x27;ve never been in contact with!
But seeing that this concerns us all....makes it a little easier.
I&#x27;m always on the move, in a Dutch Motel at the moment with 4 to ( stalkers moved straight after I got checked in, every time I&#x27;m getting out of my room, I&#x27;m being followed, with 20 to 30 people, in cars, bikes, bicycles, or as pedestrians.No matter what store I enter, there will be One or Two of them that walk in the moment I pay or even before! This has been going on now for the last 3years, even the Family yhat adopted me is involved!So you see ... it&#x27;s not that straight forward...I&#x27;m nort asking for money but support, if there&#x27;s finacial support possible I wouldn&#x27;t say no to it as I&#x27;m in Dire Straights...for real!
But being able to link up with people who share the same agenda would be more profitable at this point then monies!
Sorry for the incoherent letter, but given the situation , I&#x27;m sure you will understand!

Beginning startups probably don&#x27;t have a lot of formal policies and you&#x27;re relying on good judgement of the founders and first employees. As a company grows, they need to guard user data with access restrictions, restrict root to a few trusted sysadmins, and put in place clear rules about what what employees with legitimate access to the database are allowed to do. (And of course if your database gets owned it&#x27;s all for nothing, so you can&#x27;t protect privacy without good security.)

"8715379","goodgoblin","goodgoblin",,,"8714846","16","The article does well by pointing out that Uber isn&#x27;t the only company to do these kinds of things, and in fact almost every corporation engages in some variation of these tactics.  Everyone knows that corporations have the same psychological profile as sociopaths, but what is fascinating about the recent Uber revelations is how clumsily they play their part.  Sociopaths do not understand why society is organized the way it is, yet they do understand that it is important to appear to understand it, to appear to be a good law abiding citizen.  Sociopaths and corporations both take great pains to hide their true anti-social and parasitic intentions.  Once spotted by the herd the sociopath must restart the painstaking process of making friends, pretending to care about things real people care about, ingratiating themselves with a community and building up trust for the sole purpose of betraying that trust in secret later.<p>For many reasons, the media is generally content to let the dirty tricks companies engage in pass by without examination, leaving the machinations of the sociopathic corporate spiders mostly in the dark.  The media earns it&#x27;s keep by convincing society that their version of the truth is the best approximation money can buy.<p>The mistake Uber made was in threatening a reporter, an action which triggered a very personal response, the kind of response that humanizes the parties involved and clearly demonstrates the difference in the kinds of things Uber is willing to do to advance their goal (blackmail a reporter so they can replace more cab rides with Ubers) v.s. the kinds of goals people have (to enjoy Friday night, get home from the airport).  Though it likely won&#x27;t last long, there is a window of time where incensed reporters may ply their trade without the usual over-riding concern for their own career, and benefit society in the process.<p>Their rate of expansion potentially at risk, Uber will likely respond with a bill of rider&#x27;s rights and a corporate pledge to uphold the highest ethical standards.  In time people will be trained to think of Uber and high moral standards as closely correlated, and all the while the corporate spiders in the shadows have been watching and learning from Uber&#x27;s mistake.  Eventually Uber&#x27;s case will be used in business schools to teach the dos and don&#x27;ts of important subjects like Media Relations (1. never clumsily proclaim your intent to blackmail reporters. 2. always  restore a tarnished reputation through a combination of both marketing and policy).  Boutique marketing firms will specialize in helping corporations write privacy policies that are made to be marketed, crafted to neutralize negative impressions long enough to lull the sheep back to complacency.","1418023412","2014-12-08T07:23:32Z"

In each new market they ignore the established taxi&#x2F;limo laws, and in some they ignore more serious laws (background checks, etc).  The individual offenses are small and generally non-serious (unlicensed taxi driving, illegal fees) but when you zoom out you see that this is a company systematically encouraging thousands of small crimes every day.  When you realize that the behavior comes from the top, you can aggregate the wrongdoing into something pretty serious.<p>At first this was kind of &#x27;cute&#x27;.  We were all rooting for the little startup who said no to an old system and tried to create something better. Uber is now a huge company.  They have secured over $2B in funding and probably intending to IPO with a market cap over $50B.

Of course not. We’d need to have endless community meetings and hearings and public floggings of Google Executives.&quot;<p>2) Pole Attachments: &quot;At these rates, building a network on 100,000 poles to serve every home and business would cost Google up to $2.8 million just to rent the pole space.&quot;<p>3) Permits: &quot;Attaching fiber cable to a pole in Seattle may require a pole attachment permit, a street use permit, and land use and environmental permits, among others.&quot;<p>4) Build-out requirements: &quot;But the company has to agree to build out and serve every premise in that area. This is a lofty goal because it means all neighborhoods, rich and poor, get served, although it increases the overall cost because the company builds cable on streets with few customers.&quot;<p>None of these are unique to Google Fiber. These are hurdles ISPs, including incumbents like Comcast, face in nearly every large city. Google is just the 800-lb gorilla that refuses to play along. They&#x27;ll only install fiber in cities desperate enough to sign a contract with Google without extensive public proceedings, who will allow bypassing permit requirements that apply to everyone else.<p>What the article really highlights is the <i>real</i> reasons for the lack of ISP competition. People imagine shadowy cabals conspiring to keep out competitors, but in most cities, it&#x27;s the result of rules that aren&#x27;t facially unreasonable. Rules like build-out requirements, which apply to incumbents and competitors alike, make deploying fiber economically unattractive, sometimes even for the incumbent.<p>Contrast the telecom industry with say the cell phone industry. It&#x27;d be illegal for an ISP to do what Apple did with its first iPhone: target rich buyers, then trickle down the technology to everyone else as it recouped capital costs. The rule is deploy to everyone, or don&#x27;t deploy at all. Unsurprisingly, companies usually choose the latter. Except Google, which has the clout to demand exceptions to the rules, and the luxury of not actually being in the ISP business and only deploying in smaller municipalities willing to bend-over.","1420322554","2015-01-03T22:02:34Z"

It makes things these problems feel exceedingly random.  I get to see all sorts of application quirks that pop up when the network is not behaving exactly as the application designer would&#x27;ve hoped when they decided that some cloud api call or another should transparently affect some aspect of their ui which wouldn&#x27;t even necessarily seem like a cloud behavior to a user ...  Just listening to music from your own iTunes library without a network or with a spotty network is an exercise in extreme annoyance.<p>I understand that the cloud&#x27;s not going away -- but I would love to see apple add standard UI somewhere in all their applications to in some way indicate when network operations are in effect and something about the status.  Attempting to  build this kind of &#x27;awareness of network activity&#x27; into the ui might really help application designers avoid including codepaths that amount to &#x27;if network is bad: goto random-ruin&#x27;  throughout their application&#x27;s ...","1420427251","2015-01-05T03:07:31Z"

The last 3-4 years or so my daily driver at work is a rMBP.<p>I use Windows 7 at home, but feel <i>about</i> as comfortable in front of either system.<p>If I compare any of the last 3-4 versions of OS X to Win 7, I&#x27;d say they&#x27;re roughly comparable. There&#x27;s pluses and minuses on both sides. I just spent a few days writing some Python code on Windows, and the experience was generally about as good as OS X. Win7 is the most rock solid non-x-nix OS I&#x27;ve used, and once you learn your way around it generally flows well.<p>I don&#x27;t perceive a huge downgrade in quality on OS X. Things change, bugs get introduced. I don&#x27;t aesthetically like where Apple is going with their flat design, but the chrome of most apps I use takes up so little real-estate of what I use that I can ignore it. I think you have to do a bit more work to get an OS X machine into a real usable state than Windows. But once it&#x27;s working it&#x27;s relatively pain free. I <i>don&#x27;t</i> think it&#x27;s as stable as Win 7. But it&#x27;s like comparing 4-9s uptime to 3-9s uptime. On a day-to-day level I don&#x27;t really notice it as much.<p>I&#x27;d say uptime on my Win 7 machines is better, but Microsoft forces restarts and updates too frequently to make that kind of claim. It&#x27;s nice that OS X is a x-nix in the sense that what I do on it is more easily translatable to other x-nix systems so deployment is easier. And that&#x27;s great until it isn&#x27;t, because some tool or library or something is different or not available. But then again, development on Windows forces you to assume all sorts of crazy non-standard stuff as a constant.<p>I don&#x27;t really know where this perception that it&#x27;s getting worse is coming from. I recently fired up my 2007-era MBP and it really feels like a worse experience, top-to-bottom. Modern OS X really is nicer.<p>I suspect that people are finally starting to look at Apple products more critically (at long last). Perhaps it&#x27;s because the pace of innovation seems to have slowed down, perhaps it&#x27;s because Jobs is gone, but I&#x27;m starting to notice Apple pundits are finally starting to see that things aren&#x27;t perhaps as good as they dreamed, and looking for ways to push the fruit forward.","1420428531","2015-01-05T03:28:51Z"

People still buy them, so it&#x27;s not like you completely don&#x27;t care about them, but the importance of those sales to your bottom line is diminishing year by year as sales of mobile devices dwarf sales of Macs. And there&#x27;s no indication that those trends are going to turn around anytime soon -- no new major piece of hardware coming from Intel or somewhere that&#x27;s likely to light a fire under sales of conventional PCs, or software package so compelling it would drive the Mac into new vertical markets.<p>All of which means that maybe, if you&#x27;re Apple, you see the Mac business as basically a cow to be milked at the lowest cost possible until it dies of natural causes.

With SnowLeopard in particular, I remember three dozen releases in a row where Xcode was unusable due to obj-c garbage collection issues.  Random stuff you didn&#x27;t expect like CoreGraphics would have showstopper issues and then we&#x27;d report it and it would get fixed by the next week.<p>This resulted in extremely late releases that had a ton of bugs that we piled patches onto as time went on.<p>Craig moved the organization onto a sprint system, where we would develop new features for 2 weeks and then spend a week fixing bugs.  After 10 or 12 or 16 of these cycles, we would deem it ready and ship it out.<p>I felt this produced more stable but more conservative software.  It seemed like giant rewrites and massive features would be very difficult to introduce and if they did get done, wouldn&#x27;t happen until two thirds or so into the release cycle.<p>On the other hand, Craig has consistently been able to release on time with most of the features promised.<p>I was only there up to the release of Lion (the first Craig release), so I don&#x27;t know how updates and patches worked from then on.  Maybe they&#x27;re worse now.<p>But I&#x27;ve been using OS X all this time, and honestly I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s any worse than before.<p>What has changed is that releases and features happen more often.  Tiger and Leopard had a good 2 years to mature and get patches while their delayed successors missed target dates.  In the meantime they stagnated with ancient unix tools, safari build, QuickTime frameworks, graphics drivers etc.<p>They felt stable because they were just old, sort of like Debian stable.  Meanwhile, the development versions of Leopard and Snow Leopard (the two I spent most of my career at Apple developing) were downright horrible and unreleasable.

If you grab one end and point it in a different direction a lot of noodles break and its crappy until you get them fixed. If you turn it very slowly you can do so without breaking any noodles, but it takes a long time to get to a new orientation.<p>My assertion is that OS X (and Windows for that matter) are trying to serve two masters, one is the &#x27;appliance user&#x27; who never puts anything on their device except for what came out of the App store, and the &#x27;computer user&#x27; who uses their machine as a tool to develop software for themselves, or appliance users. While not a mainstream idea, I think a Macbook with IOS would be a better &quot;answer&quot; for application users than a Macbook with OSX, and a Macbook with OSX and none of the appliancey features might be a better Macbook for developers. Developers would no doubt run IOS in a VM on their Macbook which would both provide them a test platform when delivering new code, and a place to use their own appliancy type apps, away from the core development world. Windows could do that as well, splitting into an &#x27;end user&#x27; and a &#x27;developer&#x27; mode.<p>That said, it is really frustrating all around.","1420432884","2015-01-05T04:41:24Z"

I actually wrote a column about OS X during its early days.  All of these articles are anecdotal, and I agree with other commenters here who say it&#x27;s all about perception.  The fact of the matter is that Apple has had some high profile &quot;quality scandals&quot; the last year (some would argue 2&#x2F;3 were not deserved):<p>- iOS point release that bricked phones and was pulled<p>- Bendgate<p>- iCloud hacking scandal<p>None of them actually were OS X bugs, but you couple that with some minor OS X bugs and everything goes into a whirlwind of negative perception. What are the major OS X bugs that everyone is referring to though?  I haven&#x27;t experienced them, but that&#x27;s anecdotal, so that opinion is just as worthless as everyone else&#x27;s.  I heard people are having some Wifi issues - that sucks - but where is the showstopper that&#x27;s affecting everyone?<p>On the other hand, I do feel that iOS and Swift have been buggy enough for developers the last couple of years that its hurt Apple&#x27;s rep in a legitimate way amongst the intelligentsia - programmers who have a pedestal to preach from. But let&#x27;s be real - in terms of day to day problems, things are much much better than they were during Mac OS X 10.0 to 10.2, and yes, they&#x27;re still better than Windows&#x2F;Linux (which will always be plagued by the huge number of hardware configurations they must support).","1420434950","2015-01-05T05:15:50Z"

- selecting text for cut and paste in a text edit field is often very broken. I hit this one daily. I used to be a prolific iOS typer, but I&#x27;ve gone back to using my MacBook Air 11 just for this reason.
- selecting text in a browser windows brings out the weirdest bug, where the window gets stuck scrolling all the time. I have this OCD thing where I continuously select and deselect text for no reason whatsoever. As a result, this hits me many times per day. The only way to fix it is to kill Safari.
- When you have your phone open in landscape. Power it down. Then switch it on again in portrait, iOS doesn&#x27;t detect the change in orientation. You have to rotate to landscape and back before it notices.<p>There are just minor things, but when they hit time and again, they get annoying real quick.

Those same people are now used to the bells and whistles of OSX, and each new upgrade shows minor improvements and a few odd little features that, from what people tell me, come with the recommendation of &quot;turn off the new stuff&quot;.<p>Those who complain about Microsoft OS quality, didn&#x27;t compare Apple OS quality of a similar era.

This particular list of &quot;infringing&quot; URLs wasn&#x27;t actually, well, accurate. The problem for whoever sent this bogus takedown (Wicked Pictures or its agent) is that now they can be held liable.<p>In a case brought by EFF in response to an earlier bogus takedown from Diebold, a federal judge in California held that Diebold could be &quot;liable for damages&quot; -- even though Diebold had by that point withdrawn the takedown request and promised not to send another.<p>DMCA 512 section (f) says that someone sending bogus takedowns &quot;shall be liable for any damages, including costs and attorneys’ fees...&quot; In the Diebold case, Diebold eventually paid EFF something like $125K in lawyer fees.<p>Note that this situation probably won&#x27;t get that far. That&#x27;s because the DMCA doesn&#x27;t require Google or any other provider to comply with bogus takedown notices.

One would think that Mozilla users would turn off Yahoo search immediately, but apparently some do not.<p>Yahoo doesn&#x27;t really have a search engine, and hasn&#x27;t for five years. They resell Bing and add some in-house content.  The only reason to search with Yahoo is if you want their in-house content.<p>Bing is currently more literal-minded than Google. Google is using too much popularity-based machine learning to &quot;correct&quot; what you&#x27;re searching for.  It&#x27;s become difficult on Google to search for a non-popular thing that happens to be close to a popular search target. Google does not treat quote marks as a mandatory exact match any more, just a hint.<p>Running a search engine is so profitable that even the little guys with &lt; 1% market share make money - Ask, InfoSeek, DuckDuckGo, and Blekko are all profitable.  (Cuil blew it - no revenue model.)  The most valuable ads on the Internet are the ones on search results, because they appear when someone is actively seeking something.  Almost all other ads are interruptions.  The only thing that keeps the phone vendors and carriers from entering the search engine business is huge payments from Apple, Google, and Bing.<p>Microsoft&#x27;s current approach to Bing is unusual. Bing used to have its own CEO; the last one was Satya Nadella, who is now CEO of Microsoft. Now, various parts of Bing are under five different Microsoft VPs who also have other responsibilities.  Some people speculated that this was in preparation for closing down or selling off Bing, but that doesn&#x27;t seem to be happening.

I think the following has to happen.<p>(Just thinking out loud).<p>- Search has to be made into a replaceable service, or a commodity. This means that one could easily switch search providers without any other noticeable difference (to the user) than a difference in search results.<p>- This means that search engines should be stripped of their user-interface.<p>- Search engines should &quot;be&quot; simply APIs that browsers can hook into.
An advantage of this, is that search engines could be denied the use of scripting, which disables the possibility of user tracking through &quot;device fingerprinting&quot;.<p>- Of course, if desired, the user could enable personalization. Personalization could be handled like it is now (through user tracking). But we could invent an API that reveals only a user&#x27;s interests to a search agent. For example, you could reveal that you are researcher or a programmer, interested in technology, and certain programming languages, and you could list a set of webpages that you use regularly.<p>- Of course, different profiles could be used for different searches.<p>I imagine that the privacy-aware engines like DDG could start with the development and implementation of these protocols, and cooperate with e.g. mozilla for a base client implementation.","1420718744","2015-01-08T12:05:44Z"

You don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;m looking for hyper-detail about something, business sense to skip over irrelevant (to the position) details of a certain level, etc.","1421456259","2015-01-17T00:57:39Z"

This question asks so many things that it doesn&#x27;t really ask anything at all. No matter which field they decide dive into, if they can dive into any at all, it sheds no light whatsoever on their ability to solve problems, or their ability to learn new difficult concepts. Moreover, making assumptions about where their specialties lie because of the topic they chose to answer in is wrong--if they answered well, they could be skilled in many other topics as well, and if they didn&#x27;t, that doesn&#x27;t mean they&#x27;re incompetent--it means they didn&#x27;t know how to answer what is essentially a trick question.","1421457939","2015-01-17T01:25:39Z"

The author explores the philosophy of engineering as being the art of separating things in to their components. At the risk of spoiling some of the book, a major struggle the author goes through is the paradox that there seems to be an infinite number of ways to split some kinds of systems, with no productive work ever being done. This question feels like that... you can split it down to the tiniest discrete system and you&#x27;ll find you haven&#x27;t gained much.<p>That&#x27;s not to say that you wouldn&#x27;t gain SOMETHING, nor that it&#x27;s a bad interview question.

It&#x27;s a tiny number of &quot;devices&quot; connected to the network so it is probably expensive for Tesla. At some point it gets really expensive. One assumes the Model 3 will have the same always-on connection that the Model S&#x2F;X has. Millions of Models S&#x2F;X&#x2F;3 around the world mean a lot of communications costs. And then there are the SuperChargers, that will in time no doubt be communicating with cars too, to improve the user experience.<p>I suspect a few million &quot;devices&quot; connected to the SpaceX version of global wifi would be way cheaper than connecting to a dozen or two carriers in countries around the world.<p>Just a theory.","1421722539","2015-01-20T02:55:39Z"

You would pull the app out while you still had a few things to do in the apartment before you left, order the Uber, and then by the time you were ready it was right out front waiting. The time waiting felt very seamless, although there might have been an actual 10 minute wait. When it also first started drivers were totally okay with waiting a minute or two for you because the demand wasn&#x27;t as high back then. They didn&#x27;t want to lose a potential customer. However, now that Uber IS more abundant in Chicago you can no longer do that little technique. Most drivers will get pissy with you if they have to wait outside for more than 30 seconds, or if you are not curbside waiting for the ride when they show up. Since drivers now also have more options for people to pick up, they can be more choosy on the customers they decide to take. They can easily cancel rides if they are too far from the pickup or are waiting to get a new customer. So since you can&#x27;t &quot;queue&quot; up a ride like the &quot;old days&quot; you have order the ride when you are actually ready to go and are already waiting. Now that you do this, the wait is felt 100% by the customer (which was once avoided), if that makes sense. So what used to feel like nothing now feels like you are waiting in the cold for possible 5-10 whole minutes, which obviously often feels a lot longer that. Thus making you more likely to cancel the ride if you see an empty cab or another opportunity. So there is a bit of a catch 22 here, if I&#x27;m using that phrase correctly.<p>It does makes sense that they don&#x27;t want to expose this side of things though, because that places more blame on their own quality of drivers. It probably shows that as a city is active longer, the ratings&#x2F;quality of drivers goes down drastically. I&#x27;ve noticed it quite a bit here in Chicago, and it&#x27;s really disappointing. The average quality of driver I get nowadays is almost 1 to 1.5 stars lower than what I got 2 years ago.<p>I&#x27;m curious to find out if anyone else has had this same experience or not.","1422656779","2015-01-30T22:26:19Z"

One of the most obvious examples are schools. In my country before reform we had 1-5 marks. 1 and 2 were not considered valid mark but rather an absence of any score. So instead of five scale we had three scale. And since 3 was a placeholder for &quot;passable&quot; actual marks showing quality of the work were 4 and 5. And of course in time were invented unofficial corrections + and -, then ++ and -- etc.<p>So when adults with 20-30 years of supposed experience of grading quality of work can&#x27;t use even a simple 1-5 system then it is obvious that general population will fail at grading even more spectacularly. And thus we have 4.5 out 5 as &quot;awful&quot; score :) .","1422813377","2015-02-01T17:56:17Z"
"8981221","skuhn","skuhn",,,"8980225","2","I had routinely given Uber drivers ratings between 3-5 stars (good, better, best), because service was always good enough that I didn&#x27;t feel a need to dip lower. Then a driver mentioned that if a passenger gave him less than 5 stars, he would have been better off not taking the fare at all. That was pretty eye opening: that a $30+ fare wasn&#x27;t worth being rated a 4, because of the future lost business that results from having a 4.8 average instead of a 4.9.<p>This was a few years ago, before Uber X launched. So even then, Uber had limited their scale (which provides 50 ratings points) such that only the top 5 ratings were acceptable. I think it has only tightened since then, I rarely see a driver below 4.8 at all.<p>Now I always give drivers a 5 unless something truly unacceptable happens, in which case I file a complaint with Uber. The ratings feedback loop has been completely broken for me.<p>It&#x27;s ridiculous, and I don&#x27;t see how they get the results they want when people have no idea what each rating number is supposed to mean. Some people start at 5 and remove points for issues. Some people start at 3 and only go up if you&#x27;ve gone beyond the call of duty. The only thing that makes sense is an up &#x2F; down vote, when the scale can&#x27;t be agreed upon by all participants.<p>I suppose that the driver -&gt; passenger ratings might actually work as intended, since the drivers are presumably well aware of the reality of the ratings scale.<p>I don&#x27;t think this is unique to Uber or car services by any stretch either. I have noticed that any service with too many ratings choices seems to suffer from poor ratings quality. Yelp is my go to example here. There <i>should</i> be no shame in a restaurant rated 3 stars, but in actuality it&#x27;s seen as the kiss of death to a lot of places. Here again, some people are rating as if 3 stars is the baseline, some people as if anything more than 1 is earned at great cost. When you&#x27;re pulling your responses from everyone in the world, I don&#x27;t think you can really get consensus on a scale that goes beyond up &#x2F; down.","1422818048","2015-02-01T19:14:08Z"

While there were some advantages, upon further investigation it was not the right path forward for two important reasons. First, the Web is built on the principle of multiple independent, yet interoperable implementations of Web standards and we felt it was important to counter movement towards a monoculture on the Web. Second, given the engineering effort required, we found that we could deliver an interoperability focused engine to customers significantly faster if we started from our own engine (especially if unshackled from legacy compatibility concerns), rather than building up a new browser around an open-source engine. We will continue to look at open source and shared source models where it makes sense and look forward to sharing more details in coming posts.</i><p>This is a powerful paragraph from the article. I&#x27;m all for competition, and if they actually produce the next great browser, that&#x27;ll just mean better browsers overall (and probably even better tooling for us devs).

What if this happened to an organization responsible for helping rape victims and this person leaked the private information of rape victims to the Internet?  Would people be so willing to support the criminal? Would people be so eager to praise Github for not cooperating?<p>Just because Uber is a horrible, unethical company does not mean it isn’t protected under the law.  We shouldn’t condone crime just because we don’t like the victims.","1425323136","2015-03-02T19:05:36Z"

In the &quot;old&quot; interface, each contact had its own separate page and individual URL. Now that every contact is a &quot;card&quot; that appears as a modal dialog, I can no longer link to it directly, and any card that I&#x27;m viewing is lost as soon as I close the tab or navigate away from the page. (Note that I don&#x27;t necessarily believe that every possible application state should be represented by a URL, but something as discrete as a single contact seems pretty important to me.)<p>2. The JS captures my Cmd-F &#x2F; Ctrl-F shortcut and focuses the search bar in the header. To me, this is a huge no-no. Sometimes I just want to find some regular text on a page, not send my every keystroke to Google via a search box that gives me &quot;helpful&quot; page suggestions from Google+.<p>EDIT: Just noticed that you can still access the browser&#x27;s built-in search by hitting Cmd-F twice. A bit odd, but at least it&#x27;s not completely overridden.<p>3. The show-checkbox-on-hover behavior[1] in the list looks like something&#x27;s broken.

Maybe it will be ultimately proven to be a realistic goal, but for the people alive now, reliably getting to 100 or 115 using anti-aging technologies is far more likely than living to be 500.<p>Biomedical research and development is messy, fault-filled, slow, and never truly finished. I guarantee that &quot;disrupting&quot; organic degeneration as a result of accumulated damage is several orders of magnitude more difficult than making a dominant search engine. Gaining a rudimentary knowledge of aging systems beyond what we already have is going to take years, not to mention several paradigm shifts in how aging is considered.

Good for small businesses since they wouldn&#x27;t be able to afford a fleet of cars. Uber delivery will increase business since they will no longer be limited by their location.<p>* Tinder integration would be perfect. Users can agree upon a location via a google map in the app, and then schedule Uber drivers to pick them both up (option to share ride too). No need for either person to reveal their address to the other. Will make participants feel more safe.<p>* Vacation package integration. Not sure if this is already being done, but vacation packages can now include a dedicated Uber driver, along with the standard hotel + plane package. Will make vacations even smoother.<p>* Office lunch app uber integration. An app that lets co-workers pool money together to order lunch from local restaurants, and then have it delivered via Uber. Business for restaurant is increased since they are no longer limited by seating capacity (esp during high volume times - business plaza at 12pm for example).<p>* This idea is a combination of some of the others. Pizza Hut, Domionos, Chinese restaurants all do delivery... why not all of the other restaurants? Imagine an app that aggregates a bunch of restaurants and allows users to place orders. As the food is being prepared the app calculates all the nearby Uber drivers, the delivery locations, etc. It then finds the most efficient &#x27;load&#x27; for a single Uber driver to carry. For example, pickup food from restaurants A B R since the drop off locations are all near to each other. This allows an Uber driver to take food from more than 1 restaurant to more than 1 customer, maximizing the amount of $$ they can make and decreasing cost for the end customer.","1426667726","2015-03-18T08:35:26Z"

But even Microsoft, its maker, has been forced to admit that it is deeply unloved.<p>Internet Explorer — the software that launched the browser wars of the 1990s and became a symbol of the Seattle company’s former stranglehold on the tech world — is about to be ushered into retirement.<p>The group confirmed this week that it would not use the IE name for the new browser that it plans to ship with the next version of its Windows operating system, due later this year. The revised software, codenamed Project Spartan, is intended to catapult Microsoft beyond the Web 1.0 world for which IE was designed.<p>Nearly a decade ago, Dean Hachamovitch, the then-head of the IE business, confessed at an industry conference: “We messed up.”<p>With Spartan, Microsoft hopes to vault past IE’s weaknesses to produce a browser that is more suited to a digital life lived on multiple devices — part of the strategy of new chief executive Satya Nadella to break the company’s reliance on its old PC monopoly.<p>Tom Bedecarre, chairman of Akqa, a digital advertising agency owned by WPP, said the 20-year old brand was long past its sell-by date. “In the war of the future, which is mobile, they’re losing,” he said. “Nobody’s going to download Internet Explorer as their mobile browser.”<p>Microsoft has admitted that it failed to make IE a more loved part of daily life over the years. It even resorted to self-mockery in some of its advertising, referring to it as “The Browser You Loved To Hate”.<p>“It’s been a product problem for a long time,” said Dan Brewster, a senior interactive designer with Wolff Olins, the marketing agency. “People don’t like it,” he added, but used it only because it came pre-installed on their computers or because they were required to by their employers.<p>IE’s historic significance was sealed in the late-1990s. Designed to counter the rise of browser pioneer Netscape at the dawn of the internet, it was shipped free with the pervasive Windows operating system — a tactic that later made Microsoft the target of an antitrust investigation.<p>It overtook Netscape within three years and went on to dominate access to the online world, accounting for an estimated 95 per cent of browser usage soon after the turn of the millennium. But a combination of complacency and the failure to anticipate the shift to mobile sealed IE’s fate.<p>First the open-source Firefox browser and, more recently, Google’s Chrome ate into IE’s market share, using faster technology and slicker design to win users. Microsoft’s share of browser usage has fallen to around 20 per cent, similar to Firefox, while Chrome has risen to nearly 50 per cent, based on online activity.<p>Although being pushed into retirement, the IE name will live on, if only for a short time. A new version of IE will be included in the next Windows launch as well as the Spartan browser, to make life easier for companies that have developed software to work with the browser.","1426619187","2015-03-17T19:06:27Z"

"9257707","crdb","crdb",,,"9257212","9","It&#x27;s funny because this conversation happens again, and again, and again, and again, with every new business as they grow big enough to start caring. And somehow, multiple attribution (let&#x27;s not even discuss cross-device attribution, offline marketing, or more advanced ML-based customer identification and fingerprinting) is presented yet again as a freshly discovered Holy Grail. The first time I heard about it was when Rocket Internet told me it was invented at Zalando.<p>Google Analytics is two things:<p>- a tracker. That is, people do things on your site and what they do gets sent to a server.<p>- a data warehouse [1]. This is the part that gets people. Google stores the data, and what you see is the processed stuff that comes out of it after it&#x27;s been sliced, by Google.<p>- I said two, but a subset of the data warehouse is the data mart that Google offers on top, which is the slick Google Analytics UI in orange with your gmail login. That thing is so easy and intuitive to use that people take a very long time to switch and have very high expectations when they do so (and usually, deeply entrenched manual processes that they try to replicate with the new solution, causing countless wasted hours).<p>The tracking part is pretty much sorted out with all competitors in the market.<p>For the small sum of $150,000 + around $10,000 for BigQuery per annum, you can access a few layers of your &quot;raw&quot; data with a few days lag. This includes the famed multiple attribution, because of course GA free pulls out only the last channel (plus or minus a few rules, such as ignoring direct traffic). The API will drive you nuts and the data is not in a relational format. I would say the sampling limit is the biggest drawback of using GA Free, particularly if you track things like product impressions on a search (which might add up to 100x product views). Once you have the raw data [2] in a decent relational database, it&#x27;s very easy to get multiple attribution models of your choice, and to link them up to specific discount and customer rules, and do whatever else you want.<p>And of course, if you didn&#x27;t bother thinking through your tracking codes, you won&#x27;t get much out of Google. Google encourages you to think of the UTM parameters as &quot;tags&quot; as opposed to giving structure to your marketing tracking, and that results in some pretty messy schemas and workarounds afterwards (not their fault, but when you&#x27;re the guy who has to clean up afterwards, you grind your teeth).<p>As far as I&#x27;m concerned, a much saner approach is to host the &quot;data warehouse&quot; part yourself - as part of your production backend, fed by the tracker directly (let your DBA figure out the specifics). Then, you get the data live, and you don&#x27;t pay the Google tax. More importantly, you don&#x27;t separate your customer, product and order information - which sits in your backend - from your web analytics information - which would sit in Google&#x27;s DWH - requiring extraordinary ETL efforts. For the Google tax, you can hire a decent DBA and have enough spare change left for a very decent Postgres box on AWS RDS.<p>I&#x27;m sorry for the rant on your post, I know first hand how hard early stage sales are in SaaS (currently between contracts actually), but needed to get the last few years experience off my chest in the hope that it will save some pain to other people.<p>I also think you should make it clearer how you differ from GA. I&#x27;d love to know a. whether your tracker is any different b. whether your data warehouse, API, and so on are different c. whether your front end is different&#x2F;more limited&#x2F;more intuitive and of course d. whether your biggest USP is price.<p>[1] you can read the wiki page, but really, on a model, not implementation, level, it means &quot;the single source of truth that contains all the data my company will ever have&quot;. You cannot have multiple DWHs running in parallel. As another HN poster once said, businesses are resilient to application errors, so correctness isn&#x27;t strictly necessary; but it is a massive help and an enabler of profit generation and as such a very desirable goal.

Cab drivers in DF routinely don&#x27;t follow rules - they often share the same license amongst multiple people, they&#x27;ll lie about knowing how to get to a place and take you on a merry-go ride where they stop to ask people for directions along the way, they&#x27;ll go out of the way to extend your ride intentionally and cars will be completely devoid of seatbelts. The idea that Uber is line-stepping ignores the fact that everyone is already line-stepping but at least with Uber, you get a way better product.

"9325878","michaelpinto","michaelpinto",,,"9325557","0","Something to keep in mind is that music &quot;ownership&quot; may be a generational thing. My parents were members of the silent generation (born in the 30s) and they owned very few physical records. And it&#x27;s not to say they didn&#x27;t love music, they did -- but the way they enjoyed music was listening to the radio. So if you had a love of opera and classical music you&#x27;d listen to WQXR 24&#x2F;7 (here in NYC) which isn&#x27;t too different than a millennial who is into streaming.<p>As a Gen X member we grew up imitating Boomers by buying music in our youth (see side note below). But something to keep in mind is that unlike digital music, this was very much a tactile experience. This was because you were by the physical album as much as the music itself. And if you look at those albums you realize that the package acts as a mini-poster so it was really merchandise (as much as buying a t-shirt).<p>Also in a pre-digital age you&#x27;d get the lyrics included with the album as well. This doesn&#x27;t sound like a big deal, but in a pre-Google era getting your hand on the lyrics was something that you&#x27;d have to work at if you didn&#x27;t own the album (you might have to go to a sheet music shop, and those weren&#x27;t in every town).<p>So streaming (or what we use to call radio) may in fact be the natural order of things. Part of this may also be that music as a medium isn&#x27;t on the cutting edge of culture anymore. We tend to forget that from say the 60s until the late 80s music was leading the way as a voice for cultural change, but sadly as rock as a genre is now about 65 years old, and even rap is about 35 years old.<p>So I think the biggest challenge for the music industry isn&#x27;t technology at this point, but focusing on how to be culturally relevant again. So it&#x27;s not about a decline in digital sales, but a decline in connecting with their audience.<p>Side note: It should be noted that while Gen X did buy records we tend to forget that in the 80s the music industry was terrified by declining sales which were attributed to the youth market spending their money on new things like video games. Of course we loved music as much as previous generations did, but thanks to MTV we were experiencing it also as a streaming medium.","1428281035","2015-04-06T00:43:55Z"

Not all cloud providers will have such an easy time providing all the infrastructure necessary to run CoreOS + k8s smoothly.<p>For example, Kubernetes assigns each Pod (k8s unit of computation) an IP address, which is only simple to do if your cloud provider supplies something like a &#x2F;24 private block to your nodes. CoreOS came up with the VXLAN-based Flannel project to make this model more portable[0], but Layer 2 over Layer 3 isn&#x27;t something I&#x27;d like to throw haphazardly into my production environments. Google Compute Engine conveniently provides this setup as an option.<p>Another example of Google-favoritism is the strong preference of centralized storage--particularly GCEPersistentDisk. At first I was concerned about centralized storage by default as we know disk locality is a Good Thing (TM), but after reading a paper that claimed networking is improving faster than disks are[2], I felt somewhat better about this. However, it&#x27;s still pretty obvious that a Google Persistent Disk is the way to go with k8s[3].<p>That said, I&#x27;m really happy that Google has open-sourced this project because it is indeed a functioning, tested, and easy-to-use distributed system. I&#x27;m sure that the devs aren&#x27;t aggressively shutting out other cloud providers and that these biases are probably just a side-effect of their resource allocation process and the problems that they intend to solve (e.g. GCEPersistentDisk used to be a core type instead of a module--it has since gotten better). It&#x27;s still important to evaluate a technology&#x27;s biases and potential evolution before throwing your product on it.<p>[0] <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;coreos&#x2F;flannel"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;coreos&#x2F;flannel</a><p>[1] <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;GoogleCloudPlatform&#x2F;kubernetes&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;docs&#x2F;volumes.md"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;GoogleCloudPlatform&#x2F;kubernetes&#x2F;blob&#x2F;maste...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.eecs.berkeley.edu&#x2F;~ganesha&#x2F;disk-irrelevant_hotos2011.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.eecs.berkeley.edu&#x2F;~ganesha&#x2F;disk-irrelevant_hotos2...</a><p>[3] Do you see any other providers here? <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;GoogleCloudPlatform&#x2F;kubernetes&#x2F;tree&#x2F;master&#x2F;pkg&#x2F;volume"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;GoogleCloudPlatform&#x2F;kubernetes&#x2F;tree&#x2F;maste...</a>","1428347356","2015-04-06T19:09:16Z"

Congrats to all the Googlers, current and ex, that contributed to it. This paper should be toward the top of the reading list for anyone working on the topic.<p>Nevertheless, there are many open questions for large-scale cluster management for researchers and developer to address. Here are some of my favorite:
- The curse of overprovisioning: Borg and many other systems rely on reservation which are systematically exaggerated by users. Right sizing these reservations is one way to go beyond the 40-50% usage shown in the Borg paper (see fig 12). A promising way of doing this is Christina Delimitrou&#x27;s work using classification techniques (see <a href=""http:&#x2F;&#x2F;goo.gl&#x2F;vFf8oN"" rel=""nofollow"">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;goo.gl&#x2F;vFf8oN</a>)
- Oversubscription using better isolation mechanisms): this is what the Borg paper calls resource reclamation. Take unused (but reserved) resources from priority jobs and use them for best effort analytics. David Lo (<a href=""http:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.stanford.edu&#x2F;~davidlo&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow"">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.stanford.edu&#x2F;~davidlo&#x2F;</a>) has a very interesting paper coming up on how to coordinate cpu sets, cache partitioning, Linux TC, RAPL&#x2F;DVFS (power management) to run websearch clusters at &gt;90% by packing them with analytics without causing ANY glitch on search.

It&#x27;s not just the particulars of Apple&#x27;s execution and implementation, but just that the physical form factor of a watch inherently limits it...and the coolest things we&#x27;ve seen watches do in fiction, such as Dick Tracy&#x27;s wrist-walkie-talkie, are done just fine via smartphone. And glancing at your watch all the time is not much less of a social interruption than pulling out your phone.<p>What annoys me in reading consumer-facing reviews of the product is how much of the perceived potential is through things that should be done by <i>software</i>...for example, the ability to filter notifications from the phone...there&#x27;s no reason why a second (or third, fourth, etc) layer of notification triage can&#x27;t be implemented as a phone setting...in fact, I think iPhone&#x27;s Do Not Disturb mode is fantastically better done than its Android equivalent. But to think that the Watch, or any ancillary device, is needed to inherently solve the problem of filtering information overload...it&#x27;s as if rather than developing better spam filters, email providers just encouraged consumers to make multiple email accounts to handle the deluge.<p>So hopefully Apple increasingly opens up the API for developers, to do things far beyond what Apple has anticipated in its marketing plan.","1430231382","2015-04-28T14:29:42Z"

I just think as an interactive interface, the form factor will wind up as an evolutionary dead end for reasons similar to those by which touchpads have largely displaced trackballs.]<p>I referee soccer. This means that some number of times a year, I regularly get paid for an activity where a wristwatch is my only piece of tech and I rely on it while breathing heavily and making spectators, team officials and players express their unhappiness. I have half a dozen wristwatches in my referee bag. When I run center, I accumulate wristwatch-wearing-hours two at a time because I have to get things right. No amount of software sophistication can overcome the ergonomics of wristwatches.<p>The wristwatch form factor has poor ergonomics for an interactive device because it always requires two hands. Placing a small machine on the wrist puts it out of harms way by placing it behind our primary method for interacting with the physical world. Wristwatches work ergonomically because they require limited manipulation and are primarily displays.<p>To the degree wristwatches offer interaction, quick interactions are done by feel. Timex&#x27;s Ironman series performs its intended function well because the lap button is easy to locate without looking. However, basic wristwatch ergonomics mean that hitting that button is two handed and slows down a runner. Even worse, bringing an arm across the chest briefly inhibits full expansion of the chest and thus lung capacity. Only because the information the watch provides is so valuable is such a biomechanical cost a viable engineering tradeoff.<p>Running a wristwatch off a phone turns two-handed one-device operations into potential two-or-three-handed two-device operations. Sure, the obvious solution is a voice interface...but when everything runs on the phone, then a wristwatch is just a bluetooth microphone with a small display...with wrist mounted microphone versus headset mounted.<p>On the other hand, The wrist is a well protected place for mounting sensitive equipment on the body and the wristwatch is a reasonable form factor for sensors, yet in the long run serious sensor platforms want to be open as do the platforms for analysis of sensor data. Proprietary interfaces are not likely to be the direct road to the quantified self.","1430234523","2015-04-28T15:22:03Z"

However, after it received its funding it has tried to convince the community and investors that it can be more and started to provide container orchestration tools, i.e Swarm, Machine and so on. Docker has received most of its momentum and attention because of the work they did around the container format. Docker build, run, stop, encapsulates most users experience of Docker.<p>Docker wants to be known as a platform providing container management tools and it needs to do this quickly because Mesosphere and Kubernetes provide this type of functionality at a more mature level, albeit using somewhat different philosophies. The container format part of Docker is ultimately replaceable.<p>Google (Ventures) backing Tectonic is significant because Tectonic will provide a commercial enterprise-ready distribution of Kubernetes supporting Rocket. Rocket doesn&#x27;t need to reach feature-parity with Docker to be a notable replacement because Docker already does too much. All Rocket needs to do is provide the much needed enterprise features that Docker is lacking and integrate well with Mesosphere or Kubernetes. If this happens before Swarm and Machine mature, we could be wondering 6 months down the road what the hype around Docker was all about.<p>If Tectonic succeeds in the enterprise marketplace then Google will have stealthily marginalised Docker using community efforts through rkt and kubernetes and not had to fight them directly.","1430765173","2015-05-04T18:46:13Z"

Even at home, I won&#x27;t go to the laptop to make this search, specially if I&#x27;m discussing something with my wife.<p>In the same manner, add to this to a lot of vanity searches, like when I&#x27;m discussing something with someone and I get my phone to find out some fact. &quot;How old is the president?&quot; &quot;How much does an airplane weight?&quot;.

In almost all of these, mostly taken last year, she is 30. In another, from 2000, she is 16. But it’s the earliest one in the cluster that’s remarkable. In that picture, my cousin is only 4. Google Photos successfully matched a 4-year-old child’s face to a grown woman’s, with only a lone photo at 16 to tie them together.</i><p>&gt; <i>Places are also useful. Photos looks at a variety of signals for this, including geodata from photos. But thanks to the wealth of geographic image data Google has amassed, it can also put your old, untagged photos on a map based on landmarks that appear in them. It reliably placed many pictures I had taken in Singapore more than a dozen years ago into a cluster, for example.</i><p>&gt; <i>This makes Photos very searchable. It’s easy to find places in your pictures — even ones that aren’t geotagged. It’s equally easy to find very specific things, like Labrador retrievers, poodles, and caves. Photos also allows you to search for pictures of people doing things. I found people in poses when I searched for “yoga,” pictures of people with booze, coffee, and Coca-Cola when I searched for “drinking.” Sometimes the results are odd: photos of both wide smiles and crying faces when I searched for “laughing.”</i><p>Finally, the amazing deep learning imagery algorithms Google  and Stanford demonstrated last year [1, 2] are available for consumer benefit. But yes, it really does seem like &quot;Gmail for Photos&quot;, in that so much more of your life is now knowable by Google.<p>edit: further reflection...I have probably a TB worth of images of me and my friends over the past five years.

This is a person who managed to get high grades in an very tough undergrad major with high attrition rates, gain admission to a top PhD program (almost certainly requiring high standardized test scores), and made it thorough a doctoral program with a 35-50% attrition rate (elite med schools, by contrast, typically have attrition rates below 0.5%).<p>Now, if these salaries were going from $250K with tenure to $500k, I&#x27;m a little more sympathetic to CMU (though even then, I don&#x27;t begrudge these researchers their new and good salaries).","1433176496","2015-06-01T16:34:56Z"

Apple isn&#x27;t doing anything really great to enhance user privacy in absolutes - all they are doing is having all your data and not letting anyone else benefit from it - right now. Which is to say Apple still does benefit from your data in direct or indirect ways.<p>They are still, by default recording all your search queries on OS X. And Apple supporters&#x27; justification for that is well, Apple isn&#x27;t a company whose revenue and profits are mostly dependent on ads.  But if you look at facts, Apple wants to get a big pie of everything, not just hardware. And they go out of their way to try and get it - book sales (ref: antitrust case), iAd, Maps, Streaming Music - the list goes on and on.<p>Given this, how do you claim Apple won&#x27;t use your recorded search queries or music you listened to (Genius Recommendations) or location data or whatever else they record and we don&#x27;t yet know about - to increase their profits? They sure as hell will - that&#x27;s why they are collecting the data in first place.<p>Google is doing the same thing by showing you ads that may be of interest to you, analyzing your Google Voicemails  to increase their speech recognition accuracy, making their maps data more robust by giving you the best Navigation app for free, giving you useful reminders by looking at your email - they are doing it now and in return they are providing you with great products you can optionally use.<p>To claim that Google is doing something evil while Apple is not purely because they make money on hardware is naive and too simplistic. (Case in point - Microsoft made most of their money selling you boxed software - now a days they want you to use their services and will provide you with a free upgrade to Windows and free online Office suite down the line. They did not care about your data before, but now they do!)<p>Fact is you can either place reasonable trust on Google or Apple and continue to be part of the modern world or just drop all your devices, bank accounts, cards, get a car from 1970s and move off the grid. As much as it sounds harsh there isn&#x27;t really such a thing as 100% privacy.

"9707073","shettysr","shettysr",,,"9672171","17","Thanks for the lively discussions. I am the co-founder of fleetzen. We are a two-person startup that went live about 4 weeks back and now we are in the process of operationalizing it. Like many of you have mentioned we have a long list of operational and technical challenges to consider and address and I really appreciate you for the time and thoughts.<p>As a business we create value for three main constituents.<p>For customers – The core experience we want to deliver is that a driver&#x2F;helper with a vehicle is available at the pickup location in less than 30 minutes, on-demand, regardless of the source of request (be it stores, Craigslist, an estate sale, or an apartment etc.,) and we want to offer the service at a competitive price. They no longer have to ask favors from their friends or wait for days for the stores to deliver, or drive to rental places such as U-Haul. It will be a “cab” like experience for moving stuff. It is convenient, saves ton of time and less expensive than other alternatives.<p>For drivers –  A 2nd or 3rd job, an opportunity to make some additional income while doing some of the similar work that they used to do for free or as favors in the past. They are not the cab drivers who wait around the block. We do envision a world where, if we are successful in generating volume, they might wait around the block which could cut down our time to arrival. But we are long away from getting there.<p>Businesses - The direct effect of the above to the businesses and sellers is that, goods clear the shop floors faster with little to no overhead to them and probably increased sales.<p>Let me try to address some of the comments below.<p>CDL: As tzs mentioned our drivers do not need CDL to provide services. Washington state DOL has a nice flowchart at <a href=""http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.dol.wa.gov&#x2F;driverslicense&#x2F;cdlrequired.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.dol.wa.gov&#x2F;driverslicense&#x2F;cdlrequired.html</a> that can help you understand how we meet this requirement. We do not carry super heavy goods and most of the items can be carried by two people (just like you and your buddy would). Pickups are not designed to carry loads that breaches this criteria.<p>Insurance: I cannot probably cover all the aspects of this subject here. We are in the process of procuring insurance for the Cargo that our drivers carry and it will meet or beat the state requirements. As some of you have mentioned the damage to the goods is likely and we will be able to address it. What separates us from likes of Uber in terms of liability is that we do not let the customers ride with the drivers. If we did, it will put us in a whole different category of transport (a taxi) and liability exposure. Basically we do not expose customers to any accidents on the road. For these reasons we are less risky from insurance company stand point.<p>Trust: Chance of drivers stealing customer’s stuff is highly unlikely. The drivers go though a rigorous background check (criminal plus driving history) and we ensure that there is nothing in their past that could be damaging to the customers or to fleetzen as a brand. They are as trustworthy as any outsourced help you hire. In addition we review the driver performance on a regular basis.<p>Permits&#x2F;registration etc.,: Fleetzen, in it’s current form, is a “buddy with the truck” concept. The drivers are not movers per se. They do not provide any packing services etc.,. When customer books the service, they get a vehicle and one driver&#x2F;helper.  We are relying on the requirements listed at <a href=""http:&#x2F;&#x2F;app.leg.wa.gov&#x2F;WAC&#x2F;default.aspx?cite=480-15-181"" rel=""nofollow"">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;app.leg.wa.gov&#x2F;WAC&#x2F;default.aspx?cite=480-15-181</a> that exempts them from needing a household goods permit. It is essentially a customer assisted move. That is one way we are able to provide a great experience at a competitive price. We have business license to operate in Washington and we are Delaware corporation.<p>About Uber: Never even for once we think that Uber cannot roll-out something similar to fleetzen and crush us. They have the resources (financial and technical :)). They have an incredible infrastructure that can reach a customer in matter of 5 minutes and that is enabling them to unlock plethora of customer scenarios. Most of their “non-car” based offerings (ice cream trucks, mariachi bands, pets etc.,) have all been delivered through partnerships. The closest they have come to moving is when they partnered with Bellhops, who only provide muscles for your moving needs. As far as we know the market for large item delivery using an Uber like model is still in it’s early stages with few other players including us are trying to solve.<p>Technical recommendations: Thanks for the suggestions on SSL, email, tips.

As a reasonably important customers, we had meetings with higher-ups where they&#x27;d discuss the work that they had been doing on improving the reliability at both high and low scale which was ignored for years on end.<p>The past model for AppEngine involved some pretty heavy development work modifying the JVM and Python VM to implement multi-tenant sandboxing. This obviously doesn&#x27;t scale very well from a development perspective, and shows why new platform versions have always lagged far behind release.<p>If I were to infer what they are doing internally now, it would be replacing &quot;legacy AppEngine&quot; with &quot;container AppEngine&quot;. In a few years you&#x27;ll see them migrate everyone to containers that will scale in unsurprising ways to users of AppEngine today.<p>The reason they haven&#x27;t moved everyone over to containers is that the dev experience for containers on AppEngine sucks horribly right now and they want it to be at least as seamless as it is for Python and Java right now. They also need to migrate 100% of the legacy AppEngine console functionality over to the new cloud dashboard before they could consider this complete.<p>So my guess is that AppEngine as we know it is &quot;dead&quot;, but being replaced by a product that is a pure superset of what we have today.","1433858999","2015-06-09T14:09:59Z"

Soon.</i><p><i>The way Apple is addressing that situation is to make sure that all iOS apps support IPv6. However, many servers are still IPv4-only. To reach those, the cellular networks are going to deploy NAT64 translators. NAT64 allows IPv6 applications to access IPv4 servers. Without these translators, IPv6 applications ask the DNS for IPv6 addresses to connect to, but obviously IPv4-only servers don&#x27;t have IPv6 addresses, so a regular DNS server then returns an empty list of IPv6 addresses, leaving the application all dressed up with nowhere to go. A DNS64 server, on the other hand, creates a &quot;synthetic&quot; IPv6 address that the application can use. The packets sent to those addresses end up at the NAT64 translator, which recovers the IPv4 address of the intended destination using the IPv6 address created by the DNS64 and translates the packet from IPv6 to IPv4.

This guy&#x27;s comment was pretty enlightening:<p>&quot;I was losing money in Detroit. It took me six weeks to learn why.<p>For starters there aren&#x27;t surges in my area like some other markets. So watch your market for surges as that seems to be THE game changer.<p>Also just because there&#x27;s a surge on your app doesn&#x27;t mean you will get a surge fare. Surges can be fleeting and no one here seems to recommend chasing a surge. And pax learn to wait them out or drop location pins outside the surge map.<p>Then the gravy &#x27;airport&#x27; runs carry risk if your market&#x27;s airport requires chauffeur license, commercial plate, &amp; commercial insurance. In Detroit you risk tickets and your car impound. Uber supposedly pays the tickets &amp; impound but my time is valuable too. So I can&#x27;t risk having a bad day at the airport. Then there&#x27;s your rate per mile.<p>Here UBERX is .75cents a mile when you have a pax on a trip. No .75cents for dead miles to and from a trip. After you wash your car and increased maintenance and figure depreciation on your car with the new added mileage it was a losing proposition for me. I got lucky and found UPFN early.<p>Many do this much much longer before understanding all financial consequences. I still am not sure about tax consequences. It appears Uber drivers 1099 will also include the SRF which is money that drivers never touch. You can write it off your income tax but does it affect a driver&#x27;s social security tax? I don&#x27;t have that answer but drivers should really know tax strategies in advance also.<p>This isn&#x27;t even all the answers. This is just a brief snapshot of why I lost money driving for Uber. Some UberPeople seem to be profitable in the right markets with the right vehicle&#x2F;platform &amp; with surges. You really just need to have a crystal clear picture of your costs, time invested and potential income. Good Luck. :)&quot;","1434990145","2015-06-22T16:22:25Z"

"9776877","antimagic","antimagic",,,"9776613","0","I feel that every time this issue gets discussed, it needs to have some background information provided, because quite frankly, taxi drivers in France suck.<p>From my own personal experience, I have had the following incidents:
1) a taxi driver that took me the long way round from a train station to my home.  Thinking I was a tourist, because of my accent, he basically tried to take me for a ride thinking I wouldn&#x27;t notice. That lifted the bill by 50% compared to the usual price.<p>2) A taxi driver in Marseille that wouldn&#x27;t finish the trip until I gave him my phone number.  My choice was to either get out in the middle of one of the roughest neighbourhoods of Marseille and try and find another taxi, or hand over my phone number (which he <i>verified</i> by calling me on it before continuing) - I had to change my phone number after that one.<p>3) Countless occassions of having taxis refusing to take me as a customer because I wanted to go to a part of the city they didn&#x27;t want to go to.  One particular occassion struck me as bad - I had the car door open and one foot off the ground when he realised where I wanted to go and took off.  Considering I was a lone 35-yr old woman at the time, dressed in a business suit, he obviously wasn&#x27;t worrying about his safety.<p>4) I have a friend who actually works in the Boers (mentioned in the article).  When I&#x27;m out with him, he won&#x27;t let me get into a taxi until he&#x27;s checked the guy&#x27;s (most taxi drivers are men, and on the rare occassion I&#x27;ve had a female driver, they have been nothing but professional - make of that what you will) papers <i>and</i> flashed his badge to keep the driver on his best behaviour).<p>5) If I move my grievances out to people one removed from me (ie people I personally know), you can add in a guy getting physically hauled out of a taxi and beaten by the driver because the driver didn&#x27;t want to go where he wanted, another guy getting hit by a taxi when walking across a pedestrian crossing, only to have the taxi driver get out of his vehicule, abuse and kick said friend for slowing him down, and then driving off, and a taxi that took off with a friend&#x27;s luggage in the boot, which he never got back.<p>So yeah, I have about zero sympathy for French taxi drivers - the sooner they&#x27;re run out of business, the better.  Their latest behaviour has just confirmed for me that I won&#x27;t ever be using one again if I can avoid it.","1435226657","2015-06-25T10:04:17Z"

He had no idea where the household-name hotel was, so I had to give him directions from Google Maps. For that 10 minute trip I paid $25 + tip.<p>On the way back I took UberX, the driver was a lot friendlier and even helped to find which terminal I needed as I had no idea. Total price $6.50.

They are enumerated by the United States, many times funded nearly exclusively by them, and are often fronts for the CIA and other parts of the government.<p>The government will make causal reference to Civil Society in speeches. Civil Society is not you and I - Civil Society are organizations (many times funded again by those elements that flirt inside and outside of government boundary). For example George Soros funds huge numbers of Civil Society Organizations for US-aligned political purposes around the world.<p>The United States has discusses standards of corporate governance and responsibility under the expectation that its partnerships with international corporations overseas act as &#x27;proxies&#x27; for US government inspired cultivation.<p>US corporations are allowed and encouraged to participate in the creation of legislature. Given the inevitable pass of TPA it&#x27;s timely to mention US corporate input into the one of the largest and most important pieces of modern US foreign policy. Wall Street wrote a bill draft for the House to remove limitations on derivative trading (put in after the housing crisis) and the House passed their bill without altering it.<p>Private corporations draft and&#x2F;or research most of our legislation. Washington think tanks are critical pieces in the legislative process.<p>Private corporations own the fourth estate of our government - there&#x27;s a looong long history here to write about how this has been used for private profit.<p>The majority of NSA work (it was discovered) is outsourced to private corporations and much of our intelligence work is done by private intelligence corporations (Palantir, HB Gary Federal, Stratfor).<p>Our military uses Blackwater (now rebranded because of their human rights violations) a benefit being that if a private corporations commits war crimes - it isn&#x27;t technically the US governments fault.<p>Issues like modern surveillance (revealed by Snowden) and propaganda are not performed by placing laws on corporations that they must follow, but by partnerships. Corporations are allowed to do things that government can not and vice versa. Both benefit when an exchange can be made.<p>But probably the easiest place to see the blur and partnership between the state and the corporate world is the Republic and Democratic parties and their Commission - which also runs the presidential debates. This institution (our political parties) themselves are, legally, in practice and by definition, a corporation.<p>I do not want Apple to be law enforcement or national security enforcement.

By prominently displaying Google content in response to search queries, Google is able to leverage its dominance in search to gain customers for this content. This yields serious concerns if the internal content is inferior to organic search results. To investigate, we implement a randomized controlled trial in which we vary the search results that users are shown ­ comparing Google’s current policy of favorable treatment of Google content to results in which external content is displayed. We find that users are 45% more likely to engage with universal search results (i.e. prominently displayed map results on Google) when the results are organically determined. This suggests that by leveraging dominance in search to promote its internal content, Google is reducing social welfare ­ leaving consumers with lower quality results and worse matches.&quot;","1435584150","2015-06-29T13:22:30Z"

The market place is supply constrained. There is demand for rides but not enough matching supply. People with cars much prefer to travel alone due the inconvenience of picking up others.<p>So, in order to get the drivers you need to give them a VERY convenient option. Someone that is along their route, that would not add more than 5-10 mins of extra commute time, this is also dependent on how long the total commute is. You also need to reach these drivers, without them searching for a solution. Which is insanely expensive since the cheap acquisition strategies do not work.<p>The best way to solve this IMHO is seeding the market with drivers (supply side). Once you have the scale to guarantee a ride in a specific area you open up ride-sharing.<p>* Uber is doing this by incentivizing drivers who want to make a profit.<p>* Google is uniquely positioned to do this as well, since they have the treasure trove of Wayze data","1436207489","2015-07-06T18:31:29Z"

In reverse order of benefit, based on my amatuer analysis:<p>* For a baseline, let&#x27;s use one party (generally a person or a couple) with a personal car. Traveling someplace creates P marginal greenhouse gasses (GHG), plus there is the fixed cost of manufacturing the car (but I have no idea how much that is).<p>* Uber and taxis net GHG emissions should be worst and greater than P: Your trip uses P but added to that is the GHG generated when the taxi&#x2F;Uber car has no passenger and is &#x27;cruising&#x27;. Also, I expect taxis&#x2F;Uber cars are larger on average than personal cars, and thus less fuel efficient, because they need to fit several adults comfortably in the back. If you give up a personal car for Uber&#x2F;taxis, then you get the manufacturing benefit.<p>* Car share services (e.g., ZipCar) should net less than P emissions, if you give up a personal car when you join. The car is parked when nobody is driving it, so the marginal cost of one trip is P. But it also eliminates the emissions created from manufacturing the car, whatever that is. EDIT: As hayksaakian points out below, this is the same as buying a used car.<p>* Google&#x27;s RideWidth&#x27;s net GHG emissions should be much less than P: For every added passenger, one less car is on the road emitting P.<p>* Public transit probably is second best. The marginal GHG emissions of the bus&#x2F;train carrying your fat a-- on its normal route probably don&#x27;t amount to much. On the other hand, it probably depends on the average passenger load of the vehicle -- certainly a train&#x2F;bus with only you on it costs much more per passenger than P, but those fixed costs are spread over many more passengers than Uber&#x2F;taxis.<p>* Best of all, of course, are biking or walking. Though has anyone calculated the GHG emissions of the human energy cycle, from growing the cattle feed to transport to refrigeration to cooking to human methane emissions?<p>Also not calculated are the effect your use of one service or another has on demand, driving up the number of Uber&#x2F;taxi&#x2F;busses, etc. on the road.","1436212491","2015-07-06T19:54:51Z"

According to Apple: &quot;Extracting Data from Passcode Locked iOS Devices For all devices running iOS 8.0 and later versions, Apple will not perform iOS data extractions as data extraction tools are no longer effective. The files to be extracted are protected by an encryption key that is tied to the user’s passcode, which Apple does not possess. For iOS devices running iOS versions earlier than iOS 8.0, upon receipt of a valid search warrant issued upon a showing of probable cause, Apple can extract certain categories of active data from passcode locked iOS devices. Specifically, the user generated active files on an iOS device that are contained in Apple’s native apps and for which the data is not encrypted using the passcode (“user generated active files”), can be extracted and provided to law enforcement on external media. Apple can perform this data extraction process on iOS devices running iOS 4 through iOS 7. Please note the only categories of user generated active files that can be provided to law enforcement, pursuant to a valid search warrant, are: SMS, iMessage, MMS, photos, videos, contacts, audio recording, and call history.&quot;<p>But this blurb fails to mention that the user provided passcode can only be about 15 bits of user supplied entropy - the rest is provided by a hardware manufacturer that is also obligated by law to respond to legal request.","1436910721","2015-07-14T21:52:01Z"

A coworker just got a Thinkpad W541 and it improves on the trackpad by readding the missing thumb buttons under the spacebar.<p>The W530 and W520 weren&#x27;t much better: they didn&#x27;t have the terrible trackpads. IIRC the W520&#x27;s graphics stack worked better, but that was three years ago. I helped an intern set up a W520 and it still had some issues before we got it stable. I wouldn&#x27;t call myself a super expert Linux admin, but I do remember a day when I had to manually configure XFree86.<p>I came into IBM through acq. I&#x27;m a Mac guy these days, and was before the acq, where I&#x27;d used a HP machine with Linux when I first joined the company because there were no Macs to spare. When my pre-acq Mac couldn&#x27;t run the Linux binaries I needed for work, I switched to a T420 and disliked it. I used R4x series in college and LOVED them.<p>I&#x27;m seeing more and more Macs around my office. We were probably 60% Thinkpads with Linux, 30% Mac, 10% Thinkpads with Windows going into 2015. I had been seeing Mac growth for a while, but it was all BYOD. Now that the deal went through, most folks up for a machine refresh are choosing Macs, mostly because that&#x27;s what they own themselves. Some of the few die-hard Windows folks are even getting Macs and dual booting Windows.<p>Like others, I can&#x27;t really comment on the purchase quantity, mostly because I&#x27;m not privvy to that information!","1438444840","2015-08-01T16:00:40Z"

Given that the multiples in the private market today are even more pronounced than in the public markets, investors in venture funds are effectively paying significant premiums too.<p>Bottom line: if you like the core Google business and want some exposure to the craziest ideas in Silicon Valley, Alphabet might be attractive.

Because it is intended for real-time collaboration, a server-side component is (currently) required. While a simple implementation is part of the open source project, a more complete commercial service could handle storage, communications, security, availability, and provide a simple but powerful API for developers.

In countries where public transportation is in a better shape (e.g. a lot of western european countries) and the government is more left leaning (ie has no qualms making Uber illegal), services like Uber are a bit slower to reach the mass they are in the US, but it&#x27;s still going to happen in the long term.<p>We can&#x27;t have it both ways. Either we go full capitalist, and in this case privatized public transit the Uber way seems inevitable in the long term, creating a 2 tiered public transit system: one privatized that works really well for the higher social classes, and the regular public transit system that will further languish and deteriorate as only poorer people use it (an outcome which I personally hate and find absolutely dystopian).

So it&#x27;s pretty difficult to pin the blame for that on something that&#x27;s existed for only a few years.<p>It&#x27;s no secret that I have no love for Uber, or that I consider it just another taxi service that should be regulated as such (which doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean it should be regulated the way taxi providers are <i>today</i>).  But claims that Muni&#x27;s failure are Uber&#x27;s fault are simply laughable.  Muni was a worthless pile of garbage before Uber&#x27;s founders were born, and it wasn&#x27;t on an improving trajectory that Uber came along and trashed, either.<p>The other angle, which the author did not explore, is that private mass transit is very common and popular, as it once was in the US, in many of the world&#x27;s poorer countries.  It&#x27;s ubiquitous in Asia and Latin America, and while it won&#x27;t win any awards for speed or comfort, it is cheap, effective, and capable of operating profitably without direct subsidies.  This seems at odds with the author&#x27;s lament that those left to suffer the indignity of public transit in the US are those with no other choice.  Clearly that is a product of a political system that champions public funding of mass transit, not some inevitable outcome.<p>There are many ways to make transit (public or private) better.  I don&#x27;t believe Uber is one of them, but nothing the SFMTA has done suggests that it&#x27;s part of the solution, either.  And it&#x27;s been failing without Uber&#x27;s help.","1440607301","2015-08-26T16:41:41Z"

There are a few reasons for this, but I&#x27;ll just talk about one here, privacy.<p>Privacy is addressed in the paper but I think the real issues with it are just glossed over.  &quot;You get to see how your delegate votes&quot; is great and should absolutely be true, but there are two other sorts of privacy that matter:  privacy from the <i>electoral system itself</i>, and privacy from <i>closely related people</i>.<p>In very Googley fashion, this paper seems to take for granted that of course you&#x27;d trust the system itself with the knowledge of your votes and delegates, and that its privacy-respecting duty is fulfilled by simply not broadcasting that knowledge to the unauthorized public.  But that&#x27;s a terrible way to run a government that at least partially relies on a secret ballot as a means of expressing dissent and effecting change in the government itself, for hopefully obvious reasons.<p>The other form of privacy that matters is on a much smaller scale.

One of the major thing Internet does is to make process of voting dirt cheap. One no longer has to setup physical voting booths, deploy thousands of election officials, physically tally votes and so on. This means we can give direct democracy a real chance. Why should we let senators or presidents make <i>all</i> of the decisions for us for years? Why not just vote for every issue directly? Why shouldn&#x27;t <i>anyone</i> on Internet be able to propose a law and have it voted by people in the country directly? This can change everything...<p>...or so I thought. There are several problem with direct democracy: (1) Most people are not expert at things like foreign policy, economics and so on. (2) Many people can be heavily influenced to vote either way by creating powerful PR campaigns. (3) Most people have no time or capacity to digest tons of dense information to get the background. (4) Some information needed to make decision must remain classified.<p>This paper actually proposes a viable option here that works around many of the above issues. Instead of delegating all decisions for next 4 years to one person, we delegate case-by-cases and for arbitrary time length. This allows, for example, for a real economist to be elected to make a economy decision or nuclear scientist to be elected for Iran deal like decisions and so on. It might work.

Being able to see the GPS locations and ETA of an incoming Uber is far superior than calling a taxi and hoping they show up sometime close to when the dispatcher said they would.  Not to mention that it&#x27;s a completely friction-free experience - the driver arrives, you jump in, chit-chat a little on the way (Uber drivers are, in my experience, far more pleasant human beings that taxi drivers...), then you jump out, and they charge your card.  No frigging around with change, or having to make sure you hit an ATM before you call the cab so you have cash on hand, or getting the evil eye because you didn&#x27;t volunteer the unstated but expected tip on top of the exorbitant fare.<p>Taxi companies can die in a fire, for all I care.  The last trip I took, I had to get about 10 miles from a train station to where I was going.  The first leg, I caught an Uber, and it cost me about $13, in a clean vehicle, with a very pleasant driver.

Since those are two very different statements might be best to clarify which is accurate. When I click play it starts from 0 to 2 seconds on each and every song.

Even if it fails it&#x27;ll be a huge educational experience.<p>However, this sounds fishy for a couple of reasons - but maybe the guy just doesn&#x27;t know how to structure this.<p>With one year vesting, he wants to protect himself from the scenario where you work for 3 months and own a big chunk of the company. That&#x27;s legitimate. However, get the amount of equity on paper. You are taking a risk here too so it should be far in excess of just covering your salary at an arbitrary valuation. The general advice is that if you are not getting paid, you are a founder - your equity take should be a double digit percent of the company (typically vesting over 4 years with a 1 year cliff).<p>The other thing to consider is what he is bringing to the table. If it&#x27;s just the idea of Uber for X it&#x27;s not worth much. If he has business contacts though - for example he&#x27;s well connected to the industry X then maybe he&#x27;s bringing a lot more.<p>Don&#x27;t be a sucker though, and don&#x27;t work for free or for vague promises.

The way you describe this, the owner can fire you after 364 days, and you aren&#x27;t entitled to stock or financial compensation. And frankly, some of the people I&#x27;ve met in the startup world are sociopaths and will happily fire someone after 364 to keep a large % stakehold in their company, then will rationalise it, and sleep like a baby.<p>Now taking stock over a salary is a bad idea in general as stock in startups rarely pays out. And if you&#x27;re taking stocks in lieu of salary they should be worth MORE than salary given the levels of risk and the relative values to you (stock is worthless even for years after you receive it). Plus stock&#x27;s value is subjective anyway, are they going to get a valuation by an independant organisation, or just declare the company&#x27;s value arbitrarily?<p>Honestly the whole thing sounds like a great deal for them, and a terrible deal for you.<p>You better be best buddies with this guy to consider this since trust is key here.

If they enter a new market, it has to be big. How many high margin billion dollar industries are there? The entire watch market is just around $50 billion dollars a year. If Apple wants to continue growing like it did in the past, the watch is a distraction. They need to aim for something much bigger.<p>Besides the financial reasons, I think it&#x27;s the perfect time to break into the market. The switch to electric motors levels the playing field, giving newcomers an edge if they can move fast. But the most important part is the integration of all the systems in the car, most importantly the digital user interface. Todays cars have horrible interfaces. Manufacturers are too busy covering every possible niche with dozens of models, which makes it impossible for them to make a single great car. And even if they tried, they are too dependent on component suppliers to create a single, integrated experience of the kind Apple does.<p>There are two questions I wonder about:<p>1. How will Apple be able to make use of their experience in electronics when they move to a completely new industry?<p>2. What are the technical tricks Apple has up their sleeve? The iPod had hard drives and the click wheel, the iPhone had multitouch and a SoC that enabled a real browser, the watch had force sensitivity, haptic feedback, and a pulse meter.

"10254867","kaolinite","kaolinite",,,"10253963","4","Even though it&#x27;s hard to imagine Apple making a car, there is an awful lot of smoke around this. There has to be a fire somewhere. Lots of people are wondering how Apple can differentiate in the car market - I think (surprisingly) it comes down to price. Few people may remember this, but when Apple announced the iPad, people were shocked at how cheap it was. People knew the iPad was coming and were predicting it would start at $1000, easily. It cost $500.<p>Leaving out driverless car tech, which I&#x27;m not sure whether Apple will have ready for launch, I think the Apple Car will look and function like a $100,000 car - but will cost <i>significantly</i> less. Say, half the price. Ive, in a recent interview, spoke about how he hated so many cars on the road. Not because they were cheap, but because they were poorly designed and put together with such little care. I think, unless he&#x27;s gone off the deep end into the luxury market (which he very well may have!) he would want to produce a car that is really great - but still affordable enough that lots of people will be able to afford it[1].<p>All of that being said, and no matter how much Apple cares about the mass market, Apple will want to keep their high margins. They&#x27;ll need to bring down manufacturing costs considerably. However, if anyone can do it, it&#x27;s Tim Cook. He&#x27;s well known for being a wizard at managing supply chains. Perhaps it&#x27;ll be their first product assembled entirely by robots, who knows.<p>We&#x27;ll see what happens but if Apple are able to produce a very high quality car at a reasonable price, I suspect that it will be extremely disruptive. In the UK at least, pretty much every car under £30,000 is utter garbage. I&#x27;d love it if Apple could change that.<p>[1] I suspect, as with Apple Watch, there will also be a high-end version of an Apple Car. It will probably have the same functionality (i.e. it won&#x27;t just be a super-car) but will have extras, like a Hermès leather interior. I, for one, look forward to customising a car like a new Macbook - current car customisation screens are a pain (besides Tesla, actually, theirs isn&#x27;t too bad).","1442866671","2015-09-21T20:17:51Z"

Some people who had voice input as the default found they could no longer text at all, until they disabled Google Voice Search.  It&#x27;s not a change on the client side; it&#x27;s happening even for phones that don&#x27;t have over the air updates enabled.<p>The usual suggestions, involving clearing caches and resetting various settings, have been made, and they&#x27;re as useless as usual. The problem appeared a few weeks ago, and has been reported for at least T-Mobile and AT&amp;T, and for at least ZTE and LG phones. So it&#x27;s not carrier-specific or handset-maker specific.<p>Did this &quot;faster and more accurate&quot; change involve a change to the wire protocol?

I gave them my comp and they beat it by a large margin, to the point where they clearly weren&#x27;t considering my existing comp.

In my opinion, don&#x27;t worry about what they <i>may</i> offer you whether they know your current salary or not. You should first decide what <i>you</i> want in terms of a salary as most of us have an idea of what we want. Then pad it up a little to leave room for negotiation.<p>Then tell the recruiter &quot;My current salary is $current_salary but I would need ($expected_salary + $pad_amount) to consider joining. Is that in your range ? &quot;.  If the difference between your expected salary and current salary is huge, that is not your problem. You stick to what you want as long as it is reasonable within the market of course.<p>Let&#x27;s use a specific example. Here are the scenarios:<p><pre><code>    $current_salary = $100,000
    
    av. market salary = $130,000 (based on your research)

    $expected_salary = $130,000

    $pad_amount = $5000 (keep this low)
