This will be controlled by Facebook. Zuckerberg clarifies: ""Microsoft is the exclusive third-party provider of IAB standard ads. This is not going to go through Microsoft.

But now Facebook doesn't want to give them all the ads???? <p>If the Social Ads will be as efficient and as successful as Facebook is hoping then how would there be room for any IAB standard ads? wouldn't all companies just want to do the social ad instead?<p>(I know Microsoft was also trying to get in and try to cut Google out, but the point was to get in and take advantage not to get in, get Google out and give all the power to Facebook)","1194392311","2007-11-06T23:38:31Z","Ask YC: Did Facebook F*** Microsoft?",

In those days, everything had to be IBM-compatible. Microsoft's operating system powered IBM computers -- and, as we know, software can be highly profitable. Thus, Microsoft quickly eclipsed IBM and went on to rule the world with an iron fist.

But even though these were game-changers, they still fit within Apple's core competencies.

Battery life, CPU sharing, bandwidth — all of these are factors, too, but I think RAM is foremost. The iPhone has just 128 MB of RAM and no swap space. A good chunk of that 128 MB goes to the OS itself and the built-in apps that do run in the background — Phone, Mail, Safari, and iPod. There really just isn’t much left over. If Apple were to just allow background processing now, what would happen is that background processes would often wind up getting killed by the OS at some point when the frontmost app needs more memory. From the user’s perspective, it would seem as though background apps inevitably mysteriously fail and stop running. You can argue that you’d rather have that than no third-party background apps at all, but it’s clearly a reasonable trade-off for Apple in terms of consistency and obviousness in the user experience.<p>Wait a few years for iPhones with 1 GB of RAM and it’ll be a different story.""","1206362318","2008-03-24T12:38:38Z","John Gruber's take on iPhone background apps","http://daringfireball.net/linked/2008/march#fri-21-jens"

Big conferences like the PDC2008 are free^^. And of course there are plenty of free conference materials in other domains (Java, python and ruby).<p>So what's up with Apple being evil recently? It's been my opinion that one of the few things Microsoft does right is keeping it's developers happy. I would think this would be common sense to a company like Apple.<p>Has anyone spent 500-1000 to buy the WWDC sessions and was it worth it?

For example, they remove copyrighted material from Youtube, spam blogs from blogger and sites with high page ranks from search that only deliver the viewer the latest and greatest in malware. Doing this is great and provides a better service to all users.

"480866","futureintern","futureintern",,,"9","4","I am trying to decide whether I'd rather spend my summer at Microsoft or Amazon as an intern.  Unfortunately there's only one of me...good problem to have, I guess, but still requires a decision.  There are things I really like about Microsoft and there are things I really like about Amazon.  Everyone I've talked to from both companies seems really happy there, but I guess if they're talking to potential hires that's then it's their job to seem happy.  The team I would be on at Microsoft is a reasonably interesting one (and my potential manager seems like a really good guy); with Amazon I'd get to list team preferences after accepting my offer.  The offers are pretty similar in most respects; one is a few hundred dollars more a month than the other, which is nice but I feel that it's less important in the big picture decision of choosing a company.<p>This decision carries extra weight because although it's just an internship, assuming I do well it may become my first full time job after I graduate next year.<p>So...if anyone at HN has experience working at either company, or knows people who do, or just has some advice/insight, please share. :) Thanks!<p>(I'm a reasonably active HN user, but created this account to increase anonymity - so I'm not just wisdom leeching.)","1234588737","2009-02-14T05:18:57Z","Ask HN:  Would you rather work for Microsoft or Amazon?",

"586979","ffernan","ffernan",,,"0","1","Analyst Opinion - With Google coming to market, the OS environment is very similar to what it was in the late 80s with Microsoft in IBM's position, Apple in Apple's, and Google in Microsoft's. Windows 7 is the best operating system that Microsoft has created since Windows 95, but it breaks the same model that Windows 95 did - and Windows 95 began the cycle that effectively eliminated much of Microsoft's market control. In the end, the next three years will be one for the history books. Those who lose will go  down in infamy for their failures.<p>This battle is for all the marbles and it is particularly interesting that Apple may actually depend on Microsoft's success, because Google plans on taking both out.<p>Building dominance<p>Bill Gates is credited with making that one critical decision that turned Microsoft into the power it became and made him the richest man in the world. He gave away the OS at cost to IBM while retaining the rights. (Clicking on the link will showcase what happened to the guy who actually wrote the OS).<p>Until then, operating systems were largely provided by hardware manufactures and could never reach the level of dominance needed to control a market and the resulting eco system. By ultimately giving the software to IBM initially (while retaining critical rights) and later selling it very cheaply, Gates took control of a market and made money off of the products like Microsoft Office that were built on top of it.<p>In effect, hardware vendors outsourced the operating system to Microsoft who had given them a product that allowed them to compete with each other on hardware prowess (which is what they did best anyway).  An empire was born on one simple OS lesson: Keep it cheap, keep it simple, control the OEMs and own and profit from the applications.<p>Breaking the model<p>Once dominant, and this appears to be a repetitive and common mistake, there was an increasing need to grow the revenue from the OS. Windows 95 was created, doubling the price at a time when hardware cost had dropped by around a third and it started to feel more like a bundle of applications than just an OS, containing the UI, which had previously been a spate addition, media playing capability, several games, basic editors, disk utilities and a browser. Still, there was only one version, it was still relatively cheap (under $100 on top of $2000+ hardware) and, while weakened, it seemed bulletproof.<p>Except Microsoft was so dominant the bundle created anti-competitive problems, first with the U.S. and then with Europe. This got the government involved and, coupled with some other mistakes Microsoft made, caused them to lose their U.S. antitrust trial and put them solidly in the EU's gun sights.<p>Then the OS forked. Windows NT, which had initially been intended for workstations and servers, dropped into the business market creating two versions somewhat incompatible with each other.   They stayed this way until Windows XP and then Microsoft seemed to forget that Windows was an OS and started treating it like an application and the versions started to multiply.<p>With Vista, they blew up the model with two versions for business and four for the consumer topped by Ultimate, which, with hardware cost reductions, actually cost more than some of the hardware in the market at the time it was released. Microsoft Office became decoupled so it no longer helped drive upgrades and, for the first time ever, sales of the previous version of the OS actually increased, Microsoft lost market share, and OEMs started aggressively looking for alternatives. First with Linux and most recently with Android.<p>Microsoft forgot their lesson and Google is moving in for the kill.<p>Android<p>How do you displace Windows? You look for a technology change wave, much like Microsoft did with the PC, and then you use Microsoft's model to do the same thing Microsoft did. The wave is the Cloud and, initially, it is having a bigger effect on smartphones than PCs.<p>Google picked where Microsoft was weakest to attack first (smartphones), built a pool of developers, showcased that their model worked. But Google always planned to displace Microsoft. We'll see the initial moves late this year with the big push starting next year.<p>The Android OS will be very cheap or free to the OEMs, carriers, and cell phone companies that use it.   Google will make money off the applications, services, and advertising revenue that lies on top of this platform they will increasingly own, and, if they are as successful as Microsoft was, they will end up where Microsoft is.<p>Currently. virtually every major OEM is in talks or tests with Android. Each one is increasingly frightened that one will get this right first and steal the market, initially for netbooks and Nettops, but eventually for PCs. It is interesting to note that Google is borrowing from both Apple and Microsoft. They are modeling the user experience from Apple and the economic model is a variant of Microsoft's focused on an on-line application store to bypass retail.","1241107632","2009-04-30T16:07:12Z","Why Apple needs Microsoft to survive the coming OS battle","http://www.tgdaily.com/html_tmp/content-view-42214-119.html"

For whatever reason, it is off the internet's radar, so I thought I would post a link.<p>Basically SmartClient has everything you need to build a ""desktop app in a web app"" type of application, complete with automatic data binding &#38; synchronization and all of the main types of controls you'd ever need. Often building a SmartClient app requires just hooking controls up to data sources and letting the framework take it from there. It's LGPL and has been around for almost a decade, so its pretty battle tested. Note that bending it in a direction it doesn't want to go can be a bit painful, but generally we've found that often the problem was just not realizing that what we needed was already there in the framework.<p>v7.0 RC2 is now available, grab it here:<p>http://www.smartclient.com/product/download.jsp<p>There are also GWT bindings, check out SmartGWT.

It's 'debatable' whether this is expected behaviour or it isn't, but analytics seems to interpret every user visiting a part of the main site from a subdomain as an 'external visit' and every visit of a users page from main site as a bounce!<p>Also all the uniques and visits are double counted, and if a users visits more than one subdomain the situation gets worse.<p>I was planning to get rid of the subdomain scheme for different reasons (the extra dns lookup slows down the user when moving between pages) and I'm happy to report that the analytics statistics are now much more in line with the log files.<p>So, if you have a huge discrepancy in your logs versus your google analytics statistics and you are using subdomains, this is probably happening to you too!","1259659777","2009-12-01T09:29:37Z","Tell HN: Subdomains and Google Analytics don't mix",

For example, there are a lot of web apps running on Ruby, Python or PHP, using cloud services offered by Amazon, Heroku or Google App Engine, using open source databases, and a lot of mobile applications aimed at iPhone/Android (although, it's true, MS has no real mobile edge anymore), etc.<p>The thing is I don't really hear (or think) of Microsoft when I hear about start-ups. No start-up comes up and says it's using MS SQL Server, or Microsoft Cloud Services...or C#.<p>What's the deal with this? Is it just me, or is it true? Are there any start-ups that do use Microsoft products or languages? Any example cases?<p>If this is true, how dangerous would this be in the long term for Microsoft? And what recommendations would there be for people proficient with MS, but who want to begin a start-up.<p>I'm curious about what you think. Cheers!<p>TL;DR: I don't hear of any MS based start-ups.

"1740221","devhn","devhn",,,"14","28","Had a negative experience with MS recently.  They were very interested in licensing some code for use in bing and we did a number of presentations to the top of the hierarchy which was extremely time consuming.  In the end there was radio silence so we followed up and didn't hear back, then things were delayed multiple times on their end. It seemed highly unprofessional of the business development lead to string us along because it burns a bridge for future partnership while only gaining a delay of deployment on a competing property.<p>In any case, after following up a number of times, they finally indicated they decided to build it internally instead.   The funny part was through the demos they kept pushing for a source code review which seemed highly premature considering we had nothing signed at that point.  I am glad we didn't hand over the source.  Perhaps I am not in the most objective position, but their implementation is incredibly weak.  There is a build at all costs culture which leads internal teams to build vs buy even when the PMs see the value of buy.<p>In any case, take this story as a cautionary note to pursue parallel paths even if things are very far along on one path and the stakeholders are highly enthusiastic.<p>We have been looking at other major partners and had some success with some; but, for Yahoo we hit a wall of first level routing which seems somewhat impenetrable.  I am not wanting to attack the individuals that man the first level email routing since they are just doing their job, but they don't have a technical understanding of what is being presented--we got replies that completely misunderstood the message more than 4 times in a row--and are only able to route requests as secretary would.  So we were finally directed to http://add.yahoo.com/fast/yahoo/technology/cgi_form which is no doubt a spam honeypot where submissions never reaches the appropriate team or get reviewed in any time sensitive manner.<p>So, I would like to ask if anyone has any contacts within Yahoo, ideally within Yahoo Finance on the development side.  We actually did our usability testing with google / yahoo / x so we have some good data there.<p>Thanks for any help you can offer getting in contact with the right team lead at Yahoo!","1285781063","2010-09-29T17:24:23Z","Partnering with Microsoft: a cautionary tale.

"1812316","meelash","meelash",,,"6","7","The announcements today were interesting because Apple seems to have backtracked on a couple of their philosophies, one of them quite long-standing. The release of a low power, very small new version of the macbook air (basically a netbook, given the old processor, low memory and harddrive space, last generation graphics) is not that much of a surprise. Apple has a history of denigrating product categories it doesn't happen to be in, and then coming in and saying, ""well, it turns out the category didn't suck, just our competitors sucked at it, but here's how it <i>should</i> be done."" But the repurposing of the ""zoom"" button as a full screen button may come as a bit of a shock to some mac purists.<p>For years (decades?) now, the zoom button has been an annoyance to many people that come from Windows, and has had to be explained and defended by Mac purists, who explain the concept behind it and the ergonomics of its use and how it's superior to the Windows maximize button. Of course, it's never a good sign when a user interface concept, no matter how smart it may seem, has to be explained to users- the whole goal of good interface design is for the user to never have to think about it. But this could partly be explained as a result of a predilection for the maximize function caused by previous experience and not an innate confusion.<p>Perhaps the more significant cause for the zoom button's death is that developers were just so <i>bad</i> at implementing it. A large number of developers themselves never seemed to get what the zoom button was about, and Apple was seemingly unable to force them to get it, or explain it sufficiently. As a result, it's implementation across the platform was so inconsistent as to be exasperating even for the segment of users that understood what it was for. Basically, you had to remember what it did in which apps, and when pushing it was going to do something useful, and when pushing it would do something unexpected. The end result was, most people, including myself, just stayed away from it all together, except in one or two select apps (Safari and iTunes, in my case).<p>Anyway, whatever the reasons, it seems Apple has given up on the zoom idea many OS's after its introduction, and repurposed the zoom button as a full screen button- much closer to the maximize function of Windows- although I'm sure us Mac purist will think of key reasons why it is not an imitation, but a completely different, better, idea. :D","1287600264","2010-10-20T18:44:24Z","Apple backtracks on netbooks, zoom",

"1852309","fnl","fnl",,,"14","8","This is a possibly interesting question; I will try to explain how I just arrived at this conclusion in a discussion with some friends. Back in the rainbow-colored Apple area we were big fans of the architecture, alongside with Amiga and Atari. However, all three of them faded away because of one simple mistake: they had either vendor-lock-in (Atari, Amiga) or made it hard to develop for the platform because of exclusively proprietary tools and compilers that were impossible to come by legally (Apple). They vanished against DOS on the long run and we (had to) moved on (to DOS :S). Then came Linux and we happily switched our development platform, yet mostly still using Windows for multimedia and/or games (except for the ""core"" Linux guys, but then to them this whole question should be irrelevant, anyways). Then Jobs ""came back"" with the glorious ideas of a FreeBSD-based OSX and moving on to Intel processors that combined the two worlds,  so we switched (again). In our discussion, we at least to some degree even agreed the true reason for the recent rise of Apple is not so much in iPad or iTunes alone, but the ability to develop open software on an Intel platform that works almost as if it were Linux while having the comforts of the ""closed source"" world: no longer we have to dual-boot Linux for work and Windows for multimedia (the games guys probably still are Windows, but whatever), and a platform that is dead-simple to use for non-IT guys. All was fine and up until recently there was nothing seriously wrong. But now Apple has dropped support for Java (the probably most followed language) and at the same time has created the ""Mac App Store"" (MAS). We have already seen the reception to the ""iPhone App Store"" (PAS) from the open source community - e.g. from the VLC guys, so I won't comment on that any more. And, for the MAS, you even need to pay $99 to get ""into"" it. I have no exact idea how open source-unfriendly the MAS is vs. the PAS, but I doubt even if it seems rosy now it will not be long before there is a real difference between the PAS and MAS. So, are the Apple guys apparently about to cut one of their ""life support veins"" after the other, and Android, etc. will take over the mobile sector and Linux/Windows will be again the norm in the home computing sector? I at least am seriously considering moving back to Linux again, and I am seeing patterns in Apple's current policies that make me think the question I put out to you guys has at least some substance. So, please, comment!","1288491742","2010-10-31T02:22:22Z","Ask HN: Is Apple repeating the same mistakes it made 25 years ago?",

"2027102","Ricmerrifield","Ricmerrifield",,,"3","4","When you think about who might topple a software giant like a Microsoft or a Google, you might be inclined to think of Goliath's like, well Google and Microsoft.  The same is true of any industry, you probably think of a company of similar size or larger as being the type of company that would win a battle, or a war.<p>Actual battles and wars end up being an interesting analogy.  If you think if big battles like World War I and World War II, that’s exactly what happened – giants fighting giants from big, knowable centralized points of command.  But there are some other wars that have been fought where the little guy won (or hasn’t lost in the case of one ongoing war) and there’s a common element in all of them.  No centralized physical location to “take out” to win.  When everything is dispersed and there isn’t any one thing to take out, it’s hard to really know how big or how small opposing force is, and they can be substantially more agile.  In this situation, an organization of any size can pose a major threat to an enormous organization.  The war on terror is an ongoing war that fits this profile – it’s virtually impossible to know how big or small the opposition is, or where they are at any given time, so it’s very hard to be ready for an attack from them.  Viet Nam was a tough one for the US to really stand a chance in because it was in unfamiliar territory and there was no central location to take out to declare victory.  One could even make the same argument (at a high level) for why the British lost the American revolution.<p>So if you don’t know who Rovio or CCP are, I have already made significant progress on the path of making my point.<p>Rovio is a tiny software company out of Finland that makes a game called Angry Birds.  Angry Birds is one of those products/games that sounds so strange and so not-fun, it is a little amazing to me that it ever even became a game, but as someone who has lost many hours of my life to that game, I have to say, it’s a lot of fun and incredibly addictive. As an aside, the TV show Spongebob Square Pants falls into the same category – I would have loved to have been in the room when that show got pitched to see what caused the network to green light that nutty idea.  It is a global phenomenon, and the only thing that puzzles me is that the company hasn’t made more money from it, though I expect that will change soon.  But it’s a tiny little company of fewer than 20 people based in Helsinki and they made they #1 most downloaded iPhone application last year.  Number one in the world.  Not Microsoft, not Google, not Oracle or any other software giant you can name.  Little tiny Rovio.<p>On to CCP.<p>Still in cold Northern European countries, let’s move over to Iceland, a tiny country of about 300,000 people.  How likely are they to have a company that creates some of the most popular software in the world?  Well, that’s CCP.  Now they are bigger than Rovio, but their software is a LOT more sophisticated than Angry Birds, but in their own category (I am sure they will come up with a better category name, but for now it’s MMORPG), they are huge and growing.  Their Eve Online game boasts over 300,000 monthly subscribers (I realize an improbable coincidence with the population of Iceland) and they say their next game, which won’t cannibalize Eve customers, is going to blow people’s minds.  I visited the CCP offices in November and I haven’t been so impressed by a company, their culture, their energy, and their products in a very long time.  And I meet with a lot of companies.<p>The point is that especially now that the use of the internet is starting to mature, a company of any size can become a global phenomenon, though that’s not huge news.  The bigger news that I haven’t heard a lot of people talking about, is that when people think about who the Goliath’s like Microsoft, Oracle, Google, Amazon, VM Ware, etc. compete against, the number of “David’s” out there are becoming a pretty big foe in their own right, and the kind of warfare the Goliath’s are going to have to wage is very different from traditional World War I kinds of battles.  Lots of little (comparably) tiny rivals that are very agile.  Sure it will make sense to buy some of them up, but that won’t change the fact that the kinds of battles and wars the Goliath's are in are different and they need to think that through.<p>So the answer to the question of whether Rovio or CCP will kill Microsoft or Google?  It’s the wrong question.  It’s the aggregation of all of the little CCPs and Rovios of the world that represent the new face of competition for the giants.  Not centralized, not entirely knowable, dispersed all over the world, and very agile.<p>While this is true in the big software companies, because software is every where – I think this type of changing battlefield will touch most industries.<p>-Ric at rethinkbook dot com","1292911263","2010-12-21T06:01:03Z","Who could kill Microsoft and Google?","http://www.ricmerrifield.com/2010/12/could-rovio-or-ccp-kill-microsoft-or-google/"

As far as I remember it it went more like this.<p>* Apple pre-1996 never referred to apps, just Applications. Neither did anyone else.<p>* Sun, with Java, had Applets. I don't recall them ever being shortened to 'apps'<p>* When Steve Jobs returned to Apple in 1996 he brought with him the term 'App'. I remember cringing every time he said it in a Keynote.<p>My theory is that it's a NeXT term derived from the .app extension. But for this to be true NextStep would have needed .app bundles too (and I can't remember if it did). If not it could also be from the early days of OSX.<p>EDIT: It seems that NeXTSTEP did have Application Bundles as I had thought:

After all, the Supreme Court simply confirmed that the statutory presumption of validity afforded patents under 35 U.S.C. 282 could only be overcome with ""clear and convincing evidence"" of invalidity -- nothing new.  However, upon a more careful reading (prompted by a Facebook post by Fordham Prof. Jeanne Fromer), I now realize I was mistaken.<p>In the following passage, the Supreme Court explains that a patent provides the user with a ""right to use"" the patented invention, and not merely the right to exclude others from using the patented invention.<p>That changes everything, and will make patents ever so much more valuable.  By the stroke of a pen, the wealth of America's inventors has been vastly increased.  I sure hope they don't try to ""fix"" this.","1309371127","2011-06-29T18:12:07Z","Microsoft v. i4i Revisited","http://www.baumlegal.com/blog/"

While no substitute to ringing people up and asking them to come to your party/meetup/whatever, Facebook events serve as a great centralised location to store information about an event, such as location, date/time, and a general description of what exactly is happening.<p>Currently I've found that socially, people don't really use Google Calendar for events such as this, which is unfortunate because events are sync'd to mobile devices and there are many widgets showing agenda and the like. With Facebook, integration is fairly hackish and not particularly great.<p>However, with GCal, invitation is fairly unwieldy - relying on manually adding people one by one, and by e-mail address (which is annoying because many people have several addresses, and often you don't know people by their e-mail anyway).<p>So why not open up Google Calendar to Google+ so that you can do things such as:<p>- Invite a circle of people to an event.<p>- Comment on events.<p>- Share them on your G+ profile.<p>- RSVP with your G+ account.<p>- Have a centralised calendar entry shared by multiple people so that it can stay current, be moved, updated with new location and descriptions, that would show up on one's GCal in a nice, non-hackish way.<p>Am I alone in thinking this would be a great way to expand G+'s integration with existing Google applications in order to provide a useful feature that would extend G+ and further diminish the reason to use Facebook?<p>I'm not sure where to suggest this to Google - I'd be happy to code something like this, however, not being a Google employee I'm rather powerless to implement it.<p>Does anyone else think this could be a useful feature?","1310122279","2011-07-08T10:51:19Z","Idea for Google+...Calendar Integration",

With the introduction of Google+ Pages, that limitation should now be gone.<p>At least, it will be gone when people can create their own Google+ Pages. Right now, only the privileged few can do so, meaning large companies like Dell, Toyota, or big names like The Muppets. However, Google has said that it has started rolling out the ability to create Google+ Pages to all users who want to create one today, but as is usually the case with Google's cloud-based service, this is a gradual roll-out, that will take some time.<p>Eventually, you should be able to go here to create a Google+ Page.<p>Google has also added Google+ Pages to search results, and a ""Direct Connect"" feature that will allow users to search for Google+ pages with a ""+"" modifier to a search query. For example, to find Toyota's Google+ Page, search for +Toyota in Google's search engine.<p>How to Create Google + Page: http://www.newtechie.com/2011/11/how-to-create-google-pages-customize.html","1320742180","2011-11-08T08:49:40Z","Show HN: How to Create Google+ Pages, Customize and Share",

I'm sure I remember reading a blog post about it somewhere, but I can't find it now.<p>Specifically, Can developers check out all of windows and reasonably expect to build it on their desktop machines? or is it simply too large. Part of my thinks ""you can do it with a linux kernel, why not?"", and part of me thinks ""windows has got to be a beast - it probably takes years to compile on a desktop machine""<p>Given it's a pretty massive product, I'm interested in hearing from Ex or current microsofters about how they organize it, particularly around change, so if you are on the file system team, and you submit a change, how agile/quickly can you get feedback as to whether it's worked on not?","1362079807","2013-02-28T19:30:07Z","Ask HN: how do Microsoft do Continuous integration for windows OS?",

Earlier this morning, secret Ubers were spotted across Johannesburg, marking Uber&#x27;s entry to our first African city and our fifth continent!<p>It all started when South African football legend and African Cup of Nations winner Mark Fish opened his iPhone in Sandton and requested a ride. Minutes later, he was picked up by his chauffeur Paul and whisked away to a meeting.<p>Africa&#x27;s Heart<p>Johannesburg has long been known as Africa&#x27;s capital city - it&#x27;s economic heartbeat, cultural soul and a draw to dreamers from across the continent. And no matter what you call the city - Jozi, Jo&#x27;burg, eGoli - it&#x27;s no secret that getting around is not always pleasant; traffic on the M1 can be crushing and drivers are notoriously loose with speed limits.<p>That&#x27;s part of the reason we can&#x27;t be more thrilled to be here; so that Jo&#x27;burg residents and visitors have a safe, reliable transportation option where they can travel in comfort and style. No more waiting after a night out for a safe ride home, and no more trusting your car&#x27;s security with parking attendants on side streets.<p>Please keep in mind that during Uber&#x27;s &quot;secret testing phase&quot;, availability may be limited as we perfect the experience. We&#x27;re working hard to make additional Ubers available every day.<p>As we build our own team in Johannesburg, we&#x27;re also looking to hire a brilliant Community Manager - someone to lead marketing and be the face of Uber in Jozi. Know anyone brilliant? Let us know and we&#x27;ll make it rain Uber credits your way.<p>Keep us posted with any feedback at supportjoburg@uber.com and follow @uber_joburg for the latest news, promotions and updates.<p>Much Love,<p>Team #UberAfrica</i>","1375880719","2013-08-07T13:05:19Z","Uber has launched in South Africa",

The hacker claims he had exploited a Directory Traversal vulnerability to gain access to the domain’s registrar administration panel. He also says he accessed the MySQL database containing customer credentials.
He gained access to the google.com.tj, yahoo.com.tj, twitter.com.tjand amazon.com.tj accounts after changing their administrative email addresses to his own address. Then, he simply reset the passwords of the targeted accounts.
At the time of writing, the Google, Yahoo, Amazon and Twitter domains have been restored. I’ve sent out an email to the Tajikistan domain registrar in hopes that the organization can provide more details on the attack. This post will be updated if the registrar responds to my inquiry.","1389091408","2014-01-07T10:43:28Z","Top Domains Impacted by Tajikistan Registrar Hack,Google, Yahoo are also defaced","http://allhackersnews.com/2014/01/top-domains-impacted-by-tajikistan-registrar-hackgoogle-yahoo-amazon-and-twitter.html"

Unlike Care.com or SitterCity (which are more matchmaking) this would be more like Uber. Here&#x27;s the rough overview she came up with:<p>- All sitters are 18+, have their own transportation, are CPR certified, and background-checked<p>- You pre-register with your contact and billing information<p>- You text a main number (Twilio) requesting a sitter at a certain day&#x2F;time. A sitter is found who will accept the gig and we confirm with you<p>- Sitter brings a DropCam with him&#x2F;her and we text you a secure link which allows you to view the camera feed while you&#x27;re out (optional)<p>- Your card on file is charged. No need to get cash or write a check.<p>ADDED<p>- Strict review process. Similar to Uber, a couple strikes and a sitter is fired<p>- Video profile that is texted to you when confirming<p>- Similar to AirBnB, perhaps use Facebook to show that you have a X-degree of separation to the sitter<p>I thought I would ask the parents of HN for some feedback on her behalf. Would you ever consider using something like this?","1394139123","2014-03-06T20:52:03Z","Ask Parents of HN: Would you use an ""Uber for babysitting""? ",

I am not accusing any of these companies of colluding to fix the fee, but I am interested to hear from someone with more insight whether this can be considered a form of price fixing.<p>Obviously, they know there&#x27;s really nowhere else for third party developers to go (good luck building a competing platform), so as long as they keep their prices equal they could push that tax as high as they want. Weren&#x27;t antitrust laws designed to address oligopoly situations such as this?<p>In a similar story, Visa and Mastercard recently settled for $7.25 billion in a class-action lawsuit related to illegally fixing their processing fees:<p>http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reuters.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;2012&#x2F;07&#x2F;13&#x2F;us-creditcards-settlement-interchange-idUSBRE86C16H20120713","1397498500","2014-04-14T18:01:40Z","Ask HN: Why isn't Apple, Google, and Facebook's 30% tax illegal price fixing?",

I couldn&#x27;t ring him because his mobile ran out of battery (which I later found out when we finally met). I just kept seeing him stumble on the Uber map while we&#x27;re rushing to get to a place.<p>After 25 minutes of wait, I gave up waiting and drove out to find him (using the Uber map to track him down). I finally bumped into him coming from opposite side and he followed my car home before we could start our journey elsewhere.

"8098926","stormbr","stormbr","true",,,"28","Hello HN,<p>This is just a quick vent to the community because we&#x27;ve been so frustrated for the last couple of days. We were fearing something like this happening because of the recent AdSense scandal stuff that I&#x27;m sure most of you have read about by now.<p>Here&#x27;s what happened. We built two sites in the last month that have had explosive growth from social traffic and we registered an AdSense account, got approved, and put the ads on the sites about two weeks ago. The sites were similar (we built a custom CMS) but each had different and unique content and 100% of the traffic was real and from actual people who shared our content.<p>Starting from July 10 we were averaging a few million page views a day. So we generated about $125,000 in revenue in a 12 day period. Around July 21 we got 2 policy violation notifications from AdSense for very innocent mistakes on Ad placement, we quickly fixed them and both issues were immediately resolved.<p>Fast forward three days, we get an email saying our account is disabled for policy reasons (because the sites use the same template) and we won&#x27;t be able to get any of the revenue. We never got any warnings and it was all very immediate.<p>Our sites had very normal CTRs and CPCs. We&#x27;re really shocked at the fact that this could happen even though we did absolutely nothing worthy of such action. We only have one screenshot of the main AdSense page for one of the days and we&#x27;re kicking ourselves in the foot for not meticulously screenshoting the performance pages to use as legal proof.<p>Anyways, hope you all have good luck with your businesses but just be wary of AdSense if you&#x27;re currently using it. They can do crap like this and not explain it at all and they still manage to get away with it.","1406576529","2014-07-28T19:42:09Z","Tell HN: Google Disabled Our AdSense Account With $125K Earnings",

"8190086","okatsu","okatsu",,,"48","39","I&#x27;m a software engineering student in his twenties. My work experience has mostly been with Windows technologies (.NET, SQL Server, Windows Server, etc.) and Java for Jenkins plugins. At home, I have a Windows PC and a Macbook, but mostly develop on the latter with frameworks like Django and Rails, in Vim.<p>I know a guy at work in his fifties who long ago decided to use Microsoft technologies exclusively, and I&#x27;ve never seen someone so happy to code, because he only has one ecosystem to work with and it works well. I&#x27;ve also been bit by the Microsoft bug, but I can&#x27;t bring myself to use their tools outside of work. Visual Studio&#x27;s a great IDE (especially as of late), and C# is a really fun language, but the license costs are enormous, MSDNAA licenses are for personal use only, and Azure generally costs a lot more than a VM on Linode or Digital Ocean. BizSpark also isn&#x27;t an option unless you&#x27;re seriously starting a business.<p>I feel like I&#x27;m at a crossroads of sorts, like my coworker once has been. I prefer my experience with Microsoft, but its costs and vendor lock-in are hard to ignore. I&#x27;ve tried Mono, and it&#x27;s slowly getting there, but until vNext is production-ready and I can give it a serious try, I won&#x27;t consider it a viable option.<p>I&#x27;d just like to know if anyone else has had this experience, and if so, what led them to choose one path over another. Any advice is also welcome.<p>EDIT: I&#x27;d just like to clarify that I&#x27;m not trying to choose one platform for the rest of my life, in every aspect of it. I don&#x27;t mind learning one tool over another in a work context, but I have an interest for the startup&#x2F;entrepreneurial world, and that&#x27;s when choosing Microsoft isn&#x27;t as easy as choosing anything else.","1408301782","2014-08-17T18:56:22Z","Ask HN: Choosing between Microsoft and everything else",

When I received the receipt I noticed a $20 toll charge for the George Washington Bridge.... The only problem is, is that this is only supposed to be a $11.00 toll. When I asked UBER about this discrepancy, they responded:<p>The $20 surcharge is not only to compensate for the toll, but also the vacant ride back to NJ. NJ partner drivers are not licensed to pick up riders in NYC, so they will need to travel back empty to get their next fare.<p>Okay, that makes sense. Except that our driver told us he was from White Plains, New York and that he was hoping to catch a fare back to Manhattan so he didn&#x27;t have to pay for the return toll.<p>So not only do they overcharge me, they try to cover it up by suggesting that the driver was from New Jersey and that he&#x27;d have to deadhead it back.","1412016291","2014-09-29T18:44:51Z","Is Uber now ripping off their customers?",

I&#x27;ve tried calling them, texting them back, emailing them, and even using their online forms to ask them to stop spamming my number, but have heard nothing back from them.<p>In some way I think my rights are being violated. They are always texting me from some random number so I can&#x27;t even block that. There&#x27;s seemingly no kind of opt-out list I&#x27;m aware of.

So I needed an inexpensive hardware token option.<p>I found that the Authenex A-Key 3610 is compatible. [ If anyone knows of other compatible tokens please comment. ]<p>It&#x27;s not dirt cheap but it&#x27;s cheap enough for our intended audience: $25 per unit if you get less than 100 and down to half that for larger quantities.<p>They send you a list of SNs to private key associations for the hardware tokens you&#x27;ve purchased.  The only catch is that they represent the 160-bit key in hex so if you&#x27;re using RFC4648 formatted Base32 (e.g. the default for Google Authenticator) you just need to convert those keys.  After that you can add them to your DB just like you add keys for Google Authenticator and they&#x27;ll work with the same verification code.","1422477226","2015-01-28T20:33:46Z","Show HN: Google Authenticator Compatible Hardware Token",

Near the end of it we noticed our emails were ending up in Gmails spam folders and we stopped. Now when trying to legitimately reply to customers that messaged us through our in-site contact form (so we&#x27;re sending the first actual email) I think some of our messages are ending up in the spam filter. People that were interested in our service and contacted us first aren&#x27;t getting back to us.<p>I fucked up, yes, but is it fixable? Other than getting a new domain and re-branding our entire business of course. I like our in-site contact form because it requires people to fill out all the information we need, but if the only option is to have them email us first then I guess I can do that.","1431994825","2015-05-19T00:20:25Z","Ask HN: Can a spammer-turned-good get out of Google spam filter?",

While that can be seen as some sort of validation that I am working on something worthwhile, I can also see good reasons to pivot away from the original idea.  Whatever happens, Microsoft will get more publicity that I will.<p>I am thinking of changing the idea to focus on only helping people select places.  I feel it might be easier to sell that concept and its a bit more unique.<p>I would love to hear what others think. In particular, do people think focusing klavado on helping people pick places would be a good idea or should I stick to the original idea of creating super easy meetups?","1439392351","2015-08-12T15:12:31Z","Ask HN: Microsoft launches competitor to my startup – should I pivot?",

I learned a lot of new tech stacks and contributed well in the organisation. Even my company CTO knows about my work and query about my status to my manager. For few months, I am not seeing interesting work as I am bored of what I am doing for quite sometime close 2 years.<p>I got an offer from Microsoft C&amp;E team where they are building one interesting new product. However, they are saying they are ok to move me to Redmond in next year [not promised yet]. For sure, the office known for Work Life Balance and easy going life. Compensation is not high as startups offer more stocks and the valuation is good.<p>MS PROS:
* Better work life balance and completely new tech stack. Learning curve good be interesting
* US opportunity and till that point I will be moving back to my hometown to work<p>CONS:
* 5yrs of current stack experience
* Current recognition in office<p>Neutral:
* Compensation is not that high enough to move unless if they shift me to Redmond.","1440599128","2015-08-26T14:25:28Z","Ask HN: Whether to join in Microsoft or continue in growing startup?",
